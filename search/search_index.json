It ensures platform integrity by verifying firmware authenticity during the earliest boot stages and refusing to proceed with the boot if firmware doesn't pass the checks.  This renders platforms unbootable in an event of firmware tampering for the sake of not running an unknown and potentially compromised firmware.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Making use of Dasharo TrustRoot has serious usability implications which should be considered carefully.  For this reason firmware does not enable this security mechanism by default requiring a user to explicitly opt-in during a firmware update.</p> <p>This kind of security hardening cryptographically validates firmware against a specific private key managed by the device vendor.  Because the private key is not available to device owners, neither adversaries nor the device owners themselves can change the firmware to a version that's not signed by that private key.</p> <p>Another side-effect is that overall firmware layout becomes fixed once and for all.</p> <p>Once Root of Trust has been established by hardware validating the early stages of firmware, Measured Boot mechanism can be used to build the Chain of Trust one step at a time.  With Measured Boot the part of firmware initially validated by hardware measures code and data that it makes use of before processing or running it.  That extends the trust to the new code, which in turn does the same to the code and data that it uses, and so on.  The Chain of Trust built this way relies on a TPM device and can be validated or leveraged to store secrets, but it's only as good as its root which, in case of Dasharo TrustRoot, is established in hardware.  More detailed and somewhat more technical information about Measured Boot is available here and here.</p> <p>Secure Boot is another complementary security mechanism that benefits from Dasharo TrustRoot.  Once firmware as a whole is trusted, Secure Boot can be leveraged to ensure that only trusted device drivers or operating systems are loaded by the firmware.  Eventually the control reaches an OS that can further alter its behaviour to minimize security risks.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Again, once enabled, the firmware signing used by Dasharo TrustRoot cannot be disabled!  This is an irreversible process due to changes in the device's hardware.  For Intel-based hardware (the only supported as of September 2025), the permanent changes happen at the level of a chipset.</p> <p>To be specific, field programmable fuses (FPFs) used to store hashes of firmware signing keys are one-time programmable.  Initially, they don't hold any specific value, but once a properly configured firmware is booted, their value is set and cannot be modified ever again (this is called \"fusing\").</p> <p>Make sure you fully understand this information before choosing to flash a firmware that enforces Dasharo TrustRoot.</p>"},{"location":"glossary/#dasharo-trustroot-fusing","title":"Dasharo TrustRoot fusing","text":"<p>By default, Dasharo TrustRoot-enabled releases are published as binaries that do not lock the platform down. This means that TrustRoot is active, and unauthorized updates to the BIOS region will be detected, but the chipset fuses are not burnt. Unburnt fuses allow for replacing the chipset configuration, which would disable TrustRoot again.</p> <p>To perform proper platform lockdown, burn the fuses and permanently enable Dasharo TrustRoot with no way to disable it again, the platform must be fused. To perform fusing, follow the CPU Fusing Guide.</p>"},{"location":"newcomers/","title":"Newcomers","text":"<p>If you are new to Dasharo, this section is to help you get started using Dasharo firmware and possibly contributing to making it better.</p>"},{"location":"newcomers/#coreboot","title":"coreboot","text":"<p>If you have no prior experience with coreboot, it's highly recommended to visit OpenSecurityTraining2 and finish these courses:</p> <ul> <li>Arch4031,</li> <li>Arch4021</li> </ul> <p>OpenSecurityTraining2 provides other great courses related to firmware, which are all freely available here.</p>"},{"location":"newcomers/#docker","title":"Docker","text":"<p>coreboot needs a specific toolchain to be built, hence why it is usually built inside of a Docker.

The firmware binary can be obtained, for example, by using an external programmer (NOTE: link describes writing operation, not reading!) or by dumping the firmware via BMC.</p> <p>To use a user-provided firmware binary in an HCL report, copy it to the <code>/firmware/external/</code> directory. This can be done manually (for example, by transferring the binary on a flash drive and copying it to the destination) or over the network. The following example demonstrates the latter method, copying the binary via SCP:</p> <ol> <li>Boot up the DTS.</li> <li>Enable the SSH server.</li> <li> <p>Create <code>/firmware/external</code> directory over ssh.</p> <pre><code>ssh root@&lt;target_ip_address&gt; 'mkdir -p /firmware/external'\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Copy the firmware binary to the target platform at <code>/firmware/external/</code> via    <code>scp</code>.

It is good to prepare a table of content first, and then fill up planned chapters.</li> <li>Read twice before publish - everyone make mistakes. Before committing your changes, it is good to read this again and make sure that you do not make any typos, a dump of commands output is correct, or there are no other mistakes.</li> <li>Goal of document - Documentation is not written for everyone. Some documents contain only a list of commands with minor descriptions, some of them were created to describe research results, and others may be written for non-technical persons with a huge amount of data that are obvious and unnecessary to read by developers. Because of that, you should always know for who you are writing that document - it may be developers, testers, or non-technical management.</li> <li>Hierarchy of information - most important information should always be on top of the document. We should start with the title, short description, and table of contexts. The rest of the chapters should start with the most important one.</li> <li>30/90 rule - It is good to ask your reporter or someone else to do a quick review where approx 30% of the work was done. At this moment, you probably have prepared the initial draft of the document with a table of content and some remarks about content in planned chapters. The second review should be done when 90%  of the work is finished, and the document is almost done. With that workflow, you can make sure that you are on the same page with a reporter.</li> <li>Existing resources - We should not duplicate content that was previously described in another document. Some steps or explanations are related to a few documents, and it is not necessary to write the same again. It is good to use references to existing documents (like hyperlinks) - because of that, updating and maintenance of documentation are easier because the change in one document is related to several others. Also, if you see that a related document is outdated, it will be a much better choice to review and update them instead of writing another new one from scratch.</li> <li>Maintenance - documentation may be outdated after a few changes. We should keep that in mind and prepare an updated schedule. One of the ideas is to mark related documents in every pull request with technical changes. Of course, the best solution is to improve documentation with every change in code/architecture, but it is not always possible due to deadlines or lack of time. Marking documents to update in the future allows us to do that on better occasions - and we prevent situations where the reader must inform us that the documentation is highly outdated - or even useless.</li> <li>Archive - Projects are changing, and some topics from the past are not existing now.

The lack of performance testing is because, for most of the interested parties, the selling point of coreboot was the transparency of being open-source, and this rarely made direct comparisons about other features or functionality. Historically, most of what we could find about coreboot performance involves the lower POST times claims, but there needs to be more information regarding its runtime performance as measured in benchmarks, which is a significant point that end users are interested in. Sadly, we need more internal resources and the necessary field experience to conduct such exhaustive benchmark testing. Several significant findings came from third-party benchmarks and community reports, which is enough to know our current standing. Professional hardware reviewers should be better at performing and analyzing measures than we are.</p>"},{"location":"guides/dasharo-reviewers-guide/#why-we-ask-to-fine-tune-settings","title":"Why We Ask To Fine Tune Settings","text":"<p>In general, we found out in our limited benchmarking that performance out-of-the-box with Dasharo is measurably lower than performance with MSI proprietary firmware, in the order of 6-8% on the benchmarked Core i5 12600K. Lower performance was quickly tracked down to MSI using, by default, certain processor operating parameters that are quite different from the values stated on the Intel datasheets, resulting in alterations of the processor behavior that allows it to sustain Turbo Boost with higher clock speeds and for longer periods than otherwise possible, and thus appear to perform better overall. After normalizing across both MSI proprietary firmware and Dasharo, the values we found were different, and the benchmark difference was reduced to around 2% (21:19- 29:00).</p> <p>We also found several review websites that have already written articles and analysis about this matter. Mainboard vendors use default values above those specified by Intel (technically overclocking) to produce better performance results in benchmarks (AnandTech, TechSpot, VideoCardz, Gamers Nexus about cheating, GamersNexus about MSI default settings, GamersNexus Z490 YouTube Review, TechPowerUp, Tom's Hardware). Depending on whom you ask, using aggressive values by default can be seen either as a convenience, since the end user gets more performance without having to know how to configure the firmware, or as a form of cheating, due to the end user usually having no idea about these changes and that they are overclocking out-of-the-box. As for the time being, we're sticking to Intel specification default values; these mainboard vendors' custom optimizations hurt us because it makes the difference look much bigger than it is.</p> <p>What we want to showcase is how Dasharo (for this MSI port, coreboot + EDKII UefiPayloadPkg) performance compares against the proprietary firmware codebase. The only way to do so accurately is by ensuring that the hardware operating values are the same in both Dasharo and the original firmware so that the performance differences are not due to higher processor clock speeds thanks to higher Power Limits, unlimited Turbo Boost times, or similar tricks. Note that we are okay with out-of-the-box comparisons, but that wouldn't be directly an apples-to-apples comparison of the performance of both firmware codebases, which is our point. Thus, to make it fair, the hardware has to be tweaked to run with the same operating values on both. As you can't change values on Dasharo unless you're willing to recompile (or ask for a custom build with tweaked values), the easiest way is by bringing MSI firmware values down to Dasharo/Intel levels.</p>"},{"location":"guides/dasharo-reviewers-guide/#find-your-processor-intel-default-parameters","title":"Find Your Processor Intel Default Parameters","text":"<p>So far we've found six processor-configurable parameters that differ significantly: PL1, PL2, PL1 Tau, ICCMAX, DC_LL, and AC_LL. coreboot uses the values found on two sections of the Intel 12th Generation Intel Core Processors Datasheet (Volume 1 of 2).

Thus, with MSI values (whenever on MSI or a custom Dasharo build with those), the 12600K doesn't even reach the PL1 limit, allowing it to maintain the highest Turbo Boost clock speeds infinitely, whereas, on Dasharo (or MSI with Intel default values), the extra power consumption makes it to go beyond PL1, eventually throttling back to slower clocks to keep under PL1.</p> <ul> <li>LCC (Loadline Calibration Control) is also present in another menu as CPU   Loadline Calibration Control, but we left it at Auto. We need to find out if   changes in CPU Lite Load Control / CPU AC Loadline / CPU DC Loadline change it   or if LCC operates the same regardless of changes to the previous options.</li> <li>The most critical performance-related bug we found in Dasharo involves   benchmarking Single Thread applications on Windows 11. With Dasharo, Windows   11 CPU Scheduler likes to move threads around between P and E cores, whereas   MSI firmware on the same scenario instead always favors P cores. Such behavior   significantly affects the scores of Single-Threaded benchmarks and makes them   highly variable depending on which core type a thread spent most of its time.   There may be MSRs (Model Specific Registers) related to Intel Thread Director   that we aren't aware of that manages this. The only workaround found is to set   CPU Affinity manually, which can be performed automatically with Process Lasso,   with the bonus of using Forced Mode to continuously re-apply the CPU Affinity   settings, as some applications, including Cinebench, like to change them when   you start to run the benchmark. Of course, this will not happen on P core, only   models like 12400. We did not test manual affinity tested on Linux.</li> <li>Dasharo currently doesn't support manually changing the memory clock speeds,   and it will default to the highest standard JEDEC profile supported by the   installed memory modules. MSI firmware also defaults to JEDEC profiles, so   out-of-the-box, they're matched at memory configuration, thus not a problem.   Many enthusiast-grade DDR4 modules use 3200 MHz (maximum supported by Alder   Lake-S) or higher and have that clock speed as an XMP profile, whereas the   standard JEDEC profile could be just 2133 or 2400 MHz. In most cases, a 3200   MHz DDR4 module will run at lower speeds than expected. There are modules rated   for JEDEC 3200 MHz 22-22-22 @ 1.2V that should work in both Dasharo and MSI   firmware, in case you're interested in testing this. It is also possible to   force Dasharo to use an XMP profile if you're willing to recompile or use a   custom build.</li> <li>There are a lot of other settings and MSRs (Model Specific Registers) that we   have yet to test. We track the progress of that effort in this   issue. Public Alder Lake FSP Integration Guide documents how to set   these settings On or Off, but there are few details about how they change the   Processor behavior. The remaining 2% of performance will come from matching all   these settings.</li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>On the public datasheet, there is no DC_LL for the 8+8 150W class, only   8+8 125W, but we can confirm from alternate sources that this is the correct value.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"guides/firmware-reflash/","title":"Flashing custom firmware","text":"<p>This document describes the steps for installing, reinstalling or downgrading Dasharo firmware.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>This guide is for advanced users and firmware developers looking to install custom, older or development versions of firmware.

They are called \"blobs\" because, unlike open-source code, you can't see their internal structure, nor verify their security; they are an undifferentiated mass (or \"blob\") of binary data. While often frowned upon in the Open Source community for being inauditable and suspicious, some are required by coreboot for most of the recent platforms. Here are some common types of binary blobs you might encounter when working with coreboot:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CPU Microcode:</p> <ul> <li>Modern CPUs often require microcode updates to fix bugs or security    vulnerabilities.

We're excited to share our plans to integrate the TrenchBoot Project into Qubes OS's new Anti-Evil Maid (AEM) implementation. As you may know, traditional firmware security measures like UEFI Secure Boot and measured boot, even with a Static Root of Trust (SRT), may only sometimes be enough to ensure a completely secure environment for your operating system. Compromised firmware may allow for the injection of malicious software into your system, making it difficult to detect. To overcome these limitations, many silicon vendors have started implementing Dynamic Root of Trust (DRT) technologies to establish a secure environment for operating system launch and integrity measurements. We're excited to take advantage of these advancements through integration with the TrenchBoot Project.</p> <p>The usage of DRT technologies like Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) or AMD Secure Startup becomes more and more significant, for example, Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM) requirements of Microsoft Secured Core PCs.  In open-source projects, DRTM hasn't found its place yet, but that gradually changes. The demand on having firmware independent Roots of Trust is increasing and projects that satisfy this demand are growing, for instance, TrenchBoot.  TrenchBoot is a framework that allows individuals and projects to build security engines to perform launch integrity actions for their systems. The framework builds upon Boot Integrity Technologies (BITs) that establish one or more Roots of Trust (RoT) from which a degree of confidence that integrity actions were not subverted is derived. The project has grown a lot thanks to the previous NLnet NGI0 PET grant and now it looks for further expansion into extensive use of the DRT technologies in open-source and security-oriented operating systems like Qubes OS. Qubes OS Anti Evil Maid (AEM) software heavily depends on the availability of the DRTM technologies to prevent the Evil Maid attacks.  However, the project hasn't evolved much since the beginning of 2018 and froze on the support of TPM 1.2 with Intel TXT in legacy boot mode (BIOS). This effectively limits the usage of this security software to older Intel machines only. TPM 1.2 implemented SHA1 hashing algorithm which is nowadays considered weak in the era of forever-increasing computer performance and quantum computing. The solution to this problem comes with a newer TPM 2.0 with more agile cryptographic algorithms and SHA256 implementation by default.  Qubes OS AEM software suffers from the following:</p> <ol> <li>Lack of TPM 2.0 support to handle more secure hashes and safer design of the    TPM firmware according to a newer specification.</li> <li>Qubes OS AEM has never supported any AMD processors with AMD Secure Startup    technology. Implementing AMD support would make a huge impact and broaden    the usage of DRTM technologies.</li> </ol> <p>The initial AEM implementation relied on the Trusted Boot project, Intel's reference implementation of Intel TXT. It had never any plans to support AMD processors. TrenchBoot is filling this gap supporting both Intel and AMD hardware which makes it an ideal target to replace Trusted Boot in Qubes OS AEM implementation. Furthermore, the project grant would be used to implement the missing pieces in the Qubes OS AEM software to cover the AMD and Intel support for both TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0.</p>"},{"location":"projects/trenchboot-aem-v2/#compare-your-own-project-with-existing-or-historical-efforts","title":"Compare your own project with existing or historical efforts","text":"<p>3mdeb is a licensed provider for quality coreboot consulting services for 7 years.

However, being up to date does not prevent the firmware vulnerabilities from appearing. The Static Root of Trust (SRT) like Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot and measured boot provided by the firmware is not always sufficient to establish a secure environment for an operating system. If the firmware is compromised, it could inject malicious software into operating system components and prevent the machine owner from detecting it. Silicon vendors implement alternative technologies to establish a Dynamic Root of Trust (DRT) to provide a secure environment for operating system launch and integrity measurements. Either from SRT or DRT, these integrity measurements can be used for operating system attestation. However, DRT technologies are designed to provide the ability to establish a secure environment for integrity measurements at any arbitrary point of time instead of relying on the firmware, which requires machine reset to establish the aforementioned secure environment.</p> <p>The usage of DRT technologies like Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) or AMD Secure Startup becomes more and more significant, for example, Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM) requirements of Microsoft Secured Core PCs. DRTM hasn't found its place in open-source projects yet, but that gradually changes. The demand on having firmware independent Roots of Trust is increasing, and projects that satisfy this demand are growing, for instance, TrenchBoot. TrenchBoot is a framework that allows individuals and projects to build security engines to perform launch integrity actions for their systems. The framework builds upon Boot Integrity Technologies (BITs) that establish one or more Roots of Trust (RoT) from which a degree of confidence that integrity actions were not subverted is derived. The project has grown a lot thanks to the previous NLnet NGI0 PET grant and now it looks for further expansion into extensive use of the DRT technologies in open-source and security-oriented operating systems like Qubes OS. Qubes OS Anti Evil Maid (AEM) software heavily depends on the availability of the DRTM technologies to prevent the Evil Maid attacks. However, the project hasn't evolved much since the beginning of 2018 and froze on the support of TPM 1.2 with Intel TXT in legacy boot mode (BIOS). Because of that, the usage of this security software is effectively limited to older Intel machines only. TPM 1.2 implemented SHA1 hashing algorithm, which is nowadays considered weak in the era of forever-increasing computer performance and quantum computing. The solution to this problem comes with a newer TPM 2.0 with more agile cryptographic algorithms and SHA256 implementation by default. Qubes OS AEM software suffers from the following:</p> <ol> <li>Lack of TPM 2.0 support to handle more secure hashes and safer design of the    TPM firmware according to a newer specification.</li> <li>Lack of UEFI mode support. All modern systems boot in UEFI mode only. Legacy    boot modes are being deprecated and dropped from the PC firmware. The AEM    usage is not possible on most if not all modern machines.</li> <li>Qubes OS AEM has never supported AMD processors with AMD Secure Startup    technology. Implementing AMD support would make a significant impact and    broaden the usage of DRTM technologies.</li> </ol> <p>The initial AEM implementation relied on the Trusted Boot, Intel's reference implementation of Intel TXT. It never had any plans to support AMD processors. TrenchBoot is filling this gap, supporting both Intel and AMD hardware which makes it an ideal target to replace Trusted Boot in Qubes OS AEM implementation. Furthermore, the project grant would be used to implement the missing pieces in the Qubes OS AEM software to cover the AMD and Intel support for both TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0.</p>"},{"location":"projects/trenchboot-aem/#compare-your-own-project-with-existing-or-historical-efforts","title":"Compare your own project with existing or historical efforts","text":"<p>3mdeb is a licensed provider for quality coreboot consulting services since 2016.

Boot Services are a set of functions exposed in UEFI structures that are used to help with handling the boot process. However, the main principle of DRTM technologies is to not depend on any external code that is not a part of the operating system software to be executed after DRTM. UEFI Boot Services are a part of the firmware of which DRTM tries to be independent. The whole security concept of DRTM depends on cutting the ties with firmware. Thus the work includes implementing the capability in Xen not to use the UEFI Boot Services, which GRUB2 would terminate before DRTM is executed. Xen also contains an option not to use the UEFI Runtime Services. Runtime Services is a set of functions available throughout the whole machine lifetime, which means some firmware functionalities are available even when the operating system is launched.</p> <p>Removing the Boot Services from Xen brings certain drawbacks to the system because the Boot Services hold essential information like memory map, TPM event log, graphics framebuffer, etc. This information must be extracted by GRUB before Boot Services are terminated and passed to the Xen.

The following list guides how to perform this operation:</p> <ol> <li>Ensure the platform is disconnected from the power source!</li> <li> <p>Locate the BIOS flash memory socket. The flash memory socket is located     at the very bottom of the motherboard, below the NVMe drive (or socket if     drive not yet mounted). The following picture showcases the socket location.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Open the flash memory socket. To open the flash memory socket, it is advised     to remove the NVMe drive, as there is very little space to grab the socket     door. Moreover, the socket door is sealed with a paper-like seal; one can     use pointy tweezers or a small knife to gently cut the seal along the door     edges as marked in the picture above. Once the previously mentioned things     were done, open up the socket by pulling up the tabs on the bigger door of     the chip memory socket. Once the bigger door is freed, one should be able to     perform the same operation for the smaller door. The partially opened socket     and the hinge direction have been showcased in the picture below.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Remove the memory from the socket. To remove the memory from the socket,     one can slide tweezers underneath the memory chip to lift it up. This     operation is much easier to perform with the NVMe drive removed. The picture     below shows the removed flash memory and its orientation.</p> <p></p> <p>The first pin of the chip is always marked with a dot (stamp) on the package. The dot and the first pin were highlighted by a red circle and arrow, respectively.</p> <p>Note: While the picture shows <code>Macronix 5MX25L51245G</code> memory chip, the platform might as well come with different chips like <code>Winbond W25Q512JV</code>, therefore a chip model can differ. While the chips can be different, they shall have the same specification, therefore settings on the programmer are common for all the chips.</p> </li> <li> <p>Obtain the CH341A v1.7 programmer (the one with green PCB) and the SOIC-16     adapter. For your convenience, the right adapter has been labeled with the     platform name it was bought for.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Set the programmers as follows:</p> <ul> <li>set voltage/logic level to 3.3V,</li> <li>set the programmer to flashing mode,</li> <li>put the adapter pins into the groves and secure it.</li> </ul> <p>The above process has been shown in detail in the pictures below.</p> <p></p> <p>The picture above showcases:</p> <ul> <li>where to put the jumper (marked with a red arrow),</li> <li>how to secure the adapter, by pulling the lever down when the pins are in the grooves (marked with green arrow),</li> <li>the yellow circle showcases the 8 grooves at the rear of the programmer shall be left unpopulated. The programmer uses the first 8 pins.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>The picture above showcases:</p> <ul> <li>lever in the lock position (marked with green arrow),</li> <li>the logic level switch set to 3.3V (marked with a red arrow),</li> <li>the programmer type and version were highlighted in yellow.</li> </ul> <p>Note: On the bottom of the PCB, the programmer features a pictogram showing how to set the voltage level switch.

The red arrow and a circle showcase how to locate the first pin in the socket. The rule is the same for memory chips; the dot means the first pin. Thus, when placing memory in the socket, both dots should be aligned.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place the flash memory in the adapter (programmer). The picture below     showcases the BIOS flash memory being socketed in the SOIC-16 adapter that's     connected to the programmer.</p> <p></p> <p>To socket the memory chip in an adapter, first place it freely in the adapter. Make sure the dot on the memory chip and the dot on the adapter PCB are aligned (are in the same corner). The dots were marked with red arrows and circles.</p> <p>Finally, push the border marked with the yellow arrows down and then release them. The memory chip shall fall into place and be locked.</p> </li> <li> <p>Connect the programming combo to your computer.</p> <p>Note: Use of a USB extension cable is advised.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open up the terminal and probe the flash chip.

These follow the DIMM population procedures as stated in the Board Manual: 1 module in DIMMA2 Slot (Single Channel), 2 by adding another module in DIMMB2 (Dual Channel), and 4 by populating all 4 slots. Testing is defined as passing firmware POST and booting an OS, since what is being tested is that the Intel FSP (Firmware Support Package) component is initializing the Memory Modules. We don't stress test them for stability. Each SPD Profile is tested, so each Memory Module can have from 1 to 4 entries. You may also check out Intel memory validation results page and see the results for DDR4 UDIMM testing. Maximum ratings for Alder Lake S CPUs is also available in the CPU datasheet.</p> <p>Legend:</p> <ul> <li>Configuration 1/2/4 - means given memory module was tested in 1, 2 and 4   DIMMs populated configuration, \u2714 means successfully tested, \u2716   means platform did not boot with Dasharo, e.g. \u2714/\u2714/\u2714   means all configurations work, <code>-</code> means not tested</li> <li>Size: DIMM capacity in MB</li> <li>SPD profile: can be one of JEDEC(Standard) / XMP Profile #1 / XMP Profile #2.   Profile data:<ul> <li>Type/speed: for example DDR4-2400 means DDR4 module clocked at max 2400MHz for given profile</li> <li>Timings: for example CL17-17-17 means CAS Latency 17, tRCD 17, tRP 17 (numbers expressed in clock cycles) for given memory profile</li> <li>Voltage: memory voltage in Volts for given memory profile</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>NOTE: some XMP profiles may have lower speeds than other ones, but also have smaller CAS latency. Also the memory frequency configured in the memory controller and reported by DMI/SMBIOS may be slightly lower than advertised in the module specifications. This can vary based on the board design, CPU and many other factors.</p> <p> PRO Z690-A (WIFI) DDR4PRO Z690-A (WIFI)PRO Z790-P (WIFI) DDR4PRO Z790-P (WIFI) Manufacturer Part Number Size Speed Configuration 1/2/4 Dasharo version Source Corsair CMH16GX4M2E3200C16 8192 MB 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Corsair CMK16GX4M1D3000C16 16384 MB 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) \u2714/-/- v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Corsair CMK16GX4M2B3200C16 8192 MB 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Corsair CMK32GX4M2B3200C16 16384 MB 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) \u2714/-/- v1.0.0 Dasharo HCL report Corsair CMK32GX4M2B3200C16 16384 MB 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) \u2714/-/- v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Corsair CMK32GX4M2E3200C16 16384 MB 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.0 Dasharo HCL report Corsair CMK32GX4M2E3200C16 16384 MB 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) \u2714/-/- v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Corsair CMK64GX4M2E3200C16 32768 MB 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) \u2714/-/- v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Crucial Technology BL16G32C16U4B.16FE 16384 MB 2666 MT/s (PC4-21300) \u2714/-/- v1.1.0 Dasharo HCL report Crucial Technology BL16G32C16U4B.16FE 16384 MB 2666 MT/s (PC4-21300) \u2714/-/- v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Crucial Technology BLS16G4D32AESB.M16FE 16384 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) \u2714/-/- v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Crucial Technology CT8G4DFS8266.C8FJ 8192 MB 2666 MT/s (PC4-21300) \u2714/-/- v1.1.0 Dasharo HCL report Essencore Limited (former ISD Technology Limited) KD4AGU880-36A180X 16384 MB 2666 MT/s (PC4-21300) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report G Skill Intl F4-3600C18-32GVK 32768 MB 2666 MT/s (PC4-21300) \u2714/-/- v1.1.2 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3200C16D4/16GX 16384 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) \u2714/-/- v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3200C16D4/16GX 16384 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3200C16D4/32GX 32768 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) -/-/\u2714 v0.4.0 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3200C16D4/32GX 32768 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.0 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3200C16D4/32GX 32768 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) \u2714/-/- v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3200C16D4/32GX 32768 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3600C16D4/16GX 16384 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3600C17D4/8GX 8192 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) -/-/\u2714 v0.9.0 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3600C17D4/8GX 8192 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) \u2714/-/- v1.0.0 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3600C17D4/8GX 8192 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) -/-/\u2714 v1.0.0 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3600C17D4/8GX 8192 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.0 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3600C17D4/8GX 8192 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3600C17D4/8GX 8192 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.1-rc4 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3600C17D4/8GX 8192 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.2 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3600C17D4/8GX 8192 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.3 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3600C17D4/8GX 8 GB 2400 MT/s -/-/\u2714 v1.0.0 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3600C17D4/8GX 8 GB 2400 MT/s \u2714/-/- v1.1.2 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3600C18D4/32GX 32768 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) \u2714/-/- v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3600C18D4/32GX 32768 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.2 Dasharo HCL report Kingston KF3600C18D4/32GX 32768 MB 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) \u2714/-/- v1.1.3 Dasharo HCL report Patriot Memory 4400 C19 Series 8192 MB 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) \u2714/-/- v1.0.0 Dasharo HCL report Samsung M378A2G43AB3-CWE 16384 MB 3200 MT/s (PC4-25600) \u2714/-/- v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Silicon Power Computer &amp; Communications 16384 MB 3200 MT/s (PC4-25600) -/-/\u2714 v1.1.1 Dasharo HCL report Team Group Inc.

There is a high risk for the graphical output to break in the firmware when dGPU is connected. Effectively it leaves the only option to boot in blind into a previously installed OS (if the platform does not brick and if an OS is present on a disk). The first boot may take up to 2 minutes to fully train the memory, so be patient and wait for the Dasharo logo to appear, subsequent boots will take only seconds. MSI EZ debug leds are not supported by Dasharo and you may notice a red led to be lit. If the platform boots with an integrated GPU, you may try to plug the external GPU back and boot again.</p> <p>To flash Dasharo on the platform, execute the following command:</p> PRO Z690-A (WIFI) DDR4PRO Z690-A (WIFI)PRO Z790-P (WIFI) DDR4PRO Z790-P (WIFI) <p>Replace the <code>VERSION</code> in firmware file name with the version you want to flash.

After the command succeeds, invoke <code>sudo reboot</code> or click the reboot/restart in the GUI to reboot the board. Press <code>ENTER</code> when prompted on the screen to remove the installation media (if Ubuntu live is used). DO NOT POWEROFF THE BOARD as SMI handlers of original MSI firmware may overwrite flash contents and cause a brick.</p> <p>After migration from MSI firmware to Dasharo and reboot, the firmware will fail the memory training. After reboot wait approximately 30 seconds and then power the board off by holding the power button pushed for 5 seconds. Dasharo v1.1.0 or newer will signal the memory training failure with PC speaker beeps and blinking SATA LED. When it happens use the power button to power the board off (no need to wait 30 seconds in such case). Power on the board back. Now the memory training should not fail and after approximately 1 minute (can be nearly 2 minutes for DDR5 memory), you should get a Dasharo splash screen on the monitor.

The target temperature is set to 50 Celsius degrees which means the chip will try to keep the CPU temperature to be around 50 degrees by adapting the fan speed. Summing it up, the longer the CPU temperature exceeds 50 degrees the faster the fan will spin by slowly increasing the RPM. When the temperature is below 50 degrees for a long period of time the fan rotates with a speed of around 1000 RPM. The critical temperature is set to 90 Celsius degrees.

The multiplexer is responsible for switching between the external SPI lines and the mainboard lines routed to the external SPI flash chip. The external flash chip is soldered on a SOIC8 adapter, which is connected to the qspimux.

Vboot model assumes there is a read-only copy of the coreboot and payload called recovery partition. The recovery partition is supposed to be protected with a SPI write protection. The read-only region contains the bootblock, verstage (vboot stage used to verify other firmware components) and vboot keys and all other stages required to boot the platform in case of emergency. Typically the read-only partition occupies a space that matches the possible write protected regions of the flash chip. There are also read-write partitions (up to 2) that contain an updatable copies of the coreboot and payload. Unlike read-only partitions, read-write partitions are being verified using the signatures put into the read-write partitions. vboot checks the signature and decides whether read-write partition is safe to boot, otherwise it proceeds with execution of recovery firmware. The boot flow is shown on the diagram below:</p> <p></p> <p>In order to properly protect the firmware, one has to lock whole <code>WP_RO</code> region define by flashmap in coreboot. To locate the region offset and size one has to use cbfstool to retrieve layout:</p> <pre><code>cd /path/to/coreboot/build\n./cbfstool coreboot.rom layout -w\nThis image contains the following sections that can be accessed with this tool:\n\n'RW_MISC' (read-only, size 524288, offset 0)\n'UNIFIED_MRC_CACHE' (read-only, size 131072, offset 0)\n'RECOVERY_MRC_CACHE' (size 65536, offset 0)\n'RW_MRC_CACHE' (size 65536, offset 65536)\n'SMMSTORE' (preserve, size 262144, offset 131072)\n'CONSOLE' (size 131072, offset 393216)\n'RW_NVRAM' (size 16384, offset 524288)\n'RW_SECTION_A' (read-only, size 5750784, offset 540672)\n'VBLOCK_A' (size 8192, offset 540672)\n'FW_MAIN_A' (CBFS, size 5742528, offset 548864)\n'RW_FWID_A' (size 64, offset 6291392)\n'WP_RO' (read-only, size 2097152, offset 6291456)\n'RO_VPD' (preserve, size 16384, offset 6291456)\n'RO_SECTION' (read-only, size 2080768, offset 6307840)\n'FMAP' (read-only, size 2048, offset 6307840)\n'RO_FRID' (size 64, offset 6309888)\n'RO_FRID_PAD' (size 1984, offset 6309952)\n'GBB' (size 16384, offset 6311936)\n'COREBOOT' (CBFS, size 2060288, offset 6328320)\n\nIt is at least possible to perform the read action on every section listed above.\n</code></pre> <p>The above example shows the KGPE-D16 8MB target with vboot enabled. The <code>WP_RO</code> section is at offset of 6291456 bytes from the beginning of the flash and has size of 2097152 bytes. These numbers are in decimal, so one must convert them to hex. Either use an online hex converter or use the command in bash like a pro :)</p> <pre><code>printf \"0x%x\\n\" 6291456\n0x600000\nprintf \"0x%x\\n\" 2097152\n0x200000\n</code></pre> <p>So our WP range would be 2MB at 6MB offset <code>start=0x00600000 length=0x00200000 (upper 1/4)</code>. But before proceeding with setting the WP range, one may want to sign the firmware with own vboot keys. The Dasharo build come by default with Google vboot developer keys, so to take advantage of vboot, one should sign the binary before flashing and setting the WP range. Refer to vboot signing. Unfortunately the utilities support only 2 RW partitions for resiging. Otherwise a whole image must be rebuilt. After custo mkeys have been used to sign the ifmrware image and the image has been flashed proceed with enalbing the protection:</p> <pre><code>./flashrom -p internal --wp-range=0x00600000,0x00200000\n</code></pre> <p>Then proceed with Setting SPI status register protection and Verifying SPI write protection.</p> <p>At this point you should have your coreboot firmware with vboot well protected and ready to go.

We appreciate your patience and continued support.</p> <p>We regret to inform the community that v4.17.0.3 was the last version of the firmware sponsored by PC Engines. However, 3mdeb has since released v4.19.0.1, the final version delivered to the community using the existing model.</p> <p>As some may know, 3mdeb is a small open-source firmware consulting company based in Poland. Our team consists of passionate engineers and developers from open-source software, firmware, and hardware communities, frequent conference speakers, and people who love to tinker with bits. Every day we develop bleeding-edge low-level security solutions using top open-source frameworks. We are committed to continuing support and PC Engines hardware in the open-source firmware community but can't afford that on our dime.</p> <p>Since February 2016, we have made 87 binary releases for all PC Engines hardware platforms from apu1 through famous apu2 up to apu7. We published over 30k test results from our automated testing framework. Thanks to community feedback, we created extensive documentation. Our firmware development effort extended the lifetime value of PC Engines hardware. Most notable examples were:</p> <ul> <li>CPU Core Performance Boost feature enabling - blog</li> <li>DRAM Error Correction Code enabling - blog</li> <li>AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor enabling - issue tracker</li> <li>and many small things like a watchdog or SPI flash lockdown.</li> </ul> <p>According to PC Engines EOL statement apu2 / apu3 series availability will be: \"Based on an AMD embedded CPU, this platform should have good long term availability. This CPU should be available until 2024 according to AMD.\"</p> <p>We would like to continue support for PC Engines firmware through our Dasharo open-source firmware distribution. Further releases could include regular maintenance updates and new features such as UEFI compatibility, fwupd, Verified Boot, UEFI Setup password, DMA protection, and more. For a complete list of planned enhancements, please visit the dasharo-issues repository on GitHub.</p> <p>Your support will play a crucial role in determining the roadmap and the speed of its implementation. We hope you will support our efforts to bring these new features and improvements to the PC Engines firmware.</p> <p>We are exploring the possibility of implementing a subscription model for firmware updates.

The rest is like above:</p> <pre><code># bootblock\npflash -f -P HBB -p /tmp/bootblock.signed.ecc -F /tmp/talos.pnor\n# coreboot\npflash -f -P HBI -p /tmp/coreboot.rom.signed.ecc -F /tmp/talos.pnor\n\n# Heads\npflash -f -P BOOTKERNEL -p /tmp/zImage.bundled -F /tmp/talos.pnor\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Mount the file as flash device:</p> <pre><code>root@talos:~# mboxctl --backend file:/tmp/talos.pnor\n</code></pre> <p>Sometimes this command fails with timeout, in that case repeat it until it succeeds. Optionally, success can be tested with:</p> <pre><code>root@talos:~# mboxctl --lpc-state\nLPC Bus Maps: BMC Memory\n</code></pre> <p><code>BMC Memory</code> tells that emulated flash is used instead of real one. Host doesn't see any difference (except maybe different access times and erase block size), it still reads and writes PNOR the same way as with physical device.</p> </li> <li> <p>Start the platform as described in previous sections and test it.</p> </li> <li> <p>To get back to using real PNOR:</p> <pre><code>root@talos:~# mboxctl --backend vpnor\nFailed to post message: Connection timed out\nroot@talos:~# mboxctl --lpc-state\nLPC Bus Maps: Flash Device\n</code></pre> <p>Even though that command reports failure, it maps LPC back to flash device. This can be tested with <code>mboxctl --lpc-state</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Flash tested image to permanent storage:</p> <pre><code>root@talos:~# pflash -E -p /tmp/talos.pnor\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> <p>The other method is described on Raptor's wiki and requires starting <code>mboxd</code> manually (still needs BMC firmware v2.00+). It's worth to take a look there because sometimes <code>mboxd</code> stops working (<code>mboxctl</code> errors every time) and that page shows how it can be started.</p>"},{"location":"variants/talos_2/overview/","title":"Overview","text":"<ul> <li>Releases -

If you need a Dasharo compatible Intel ME update for your device, contact us via already established commercial support channel.</p> <p>When flashing binaries with ME binary included, flashing of the whole chip is required. Follow the steps below:</p> <ul> <li>Power off the laptop</li> <li>While holding the Fn+M keys, power on the laptop - This unlocks the ME and   allows for it to be overwritten.
