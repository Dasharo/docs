# Dasharo Quality Principles

## Secure Delivery

Each Dasharo release is secured cryptographically, ensuring with RSA 4096 keys
the authenticity of binary SHA-256 integrity checksum. The three-step key
verification is guarantees that your client receives a clean file without any
third-party modifications. Integrity and signature verification procedure is
included, so that the key compliance can be easily checked.

## Secure Maintenance

Dasharo doesn't believe in security through obscurity. That is why each Dasharo
firmware is supported with the system of Transparent Validation, proving its
efficiency and quality with testing results. As an Open Source product, it
provides timely emergency releases and patches together with long-lasting
maintenance.

## Credibility

Dasharo values credibility. Each release is extended by a validation report
based on a project charter and a complete changelog with a description of the
product versioning.

## Transparency

Generic testing procedures for a given Dasharo product line are included in the
product documentation. Specific testing procedures are delivered in the form of
a PDF document accompanying a release.

## Availability

Dasharo product line page includes a hardware compatibility platform list. The
platform for which the new product line is created becomes its reference
platform. The consecutive hardware platforms are added to the hardware compatibility
list (HCL).

## Compliance

No danger of version lock. Dasharo releases are versioned according to the
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] (https://semver.org/) specification for the sake of
consistency. Release notes comply with the [Keep A Changelog 1.0.0]
specification (https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
