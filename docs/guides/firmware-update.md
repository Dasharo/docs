# Firmware update

## Introduction

This document is a guide for updating firmware on your Dasharo-powered device.

!!! tip

    If your current firmware supports UEFI Update Capsules, there is a dedicated
    [guide on their usage](../guides/capsule-update.md).  If unsure, check out
    [the compatibility table](../guides/capsule-update.md#supported-devices)
    there.

## Firmware Update Mode

Newer Dasharo releases support Firmware Update Mode, which performs updates
automatically over the network.

!!! question "Does my device support Firmware Update Mode?"

    Not sure if your device supports Firmware Update Mode? Check out the
    [compatibility table](../kb/firmware-update-mode.md#supported-devices) in the
    Knowledge Base section.

To enter Firmware Update Mode:

1. Enter the Setup Menu and navigate to Dasharo System Features:

1. When prompted, press Enter to accept. The device will reboot in Firmware
  Update Mode.

1. After reboot, when prompted, press the indicated key on the keyboard.
  Alternatively, to abort Firmware Update Mode, press Enter instead or simply
  wait for the timeout to expire.

Once in Firmware Update Mode, proceed with the firmware update steps outlined
in device-specific documentation.

After the firmware update is finished, the device will reboot automatically. If
the update includes an Embedded Controller firmware update, it will be applied
automatically after reboot and the device will reboot again.

    Check out a more detailed explanation and rationale for Firmware Update Mode
    in the [Knowledge Base](../kb/firmware-update-mode.md) section.

## Manual update

Firmware versions without support for Firmware Update Mode have various update
procedures. Check out your device's Firmware Update documentation for more
information.

## Known issues

### Problem

Platform: `MSI`

The following warnings appear when updating Dasharo:

```bash
The firmware binary to be flashed contains Flash Descriptor (FD), but FD is not writable!
The firmware binary contains Management Engine (ME), but ME is not disabled!
```

### Solution

The locked Flash Descriptor makes it impossible to unlock and flash the
Management Engine. The problem is not critical and you may continue with the
update process. Your firmware will contain old ME. However, we advise to perform
additional steps to flash it, as the old ME may cause some issues in the future.
To do that, you will have to flash firmware with FD and ME externally using
FlashBIOS. This will bypass the locks on those regions. If you wish to proceed
with this approach, please follow the steps in the
[recovery guide][recovery-msi]. Keep in mind that the memory will need to be
trained again, and firmware settings will be reset.

### Problem

Platform: `MSI Z790-P DDR4`

Dasharo version: Before `v0.9.2`

FlashBIOS does not work

### Solution

The problem is likely caused by the fact that we changed the versioning scheme
of firmware. Due to this mismatch, FlashBIOS only works for `Z790-P DDR4` since
`v0.9.2`. If you wish to update to that version, you will first need to flash
the BIOS region with `v0.9.2` firmware and then use FlashBIOS to flash
everything, including ME. You can flash BIOS with the following command:

```bash
flashrom -p internal --noverify-all --ifd -i bios -w <firmware_file>
```
