Dasharo Value Proposition
-------------------------

There are multiple reasons why you should choose Dasharo. In this section we
will try to structure and present whole value that Dasharo can bring to your
hardware.

* [Marketing](marketing.md) - Dasharo Marketing Module was created to resolve
  problems of hardware vendors with communicating [Embedded Firmware](../glossary.md#embedded-firmware) value.

Finally, we agree with John Hennessy and David Patterson that we enter era of
[New Golden Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LVeEjsn8Ts) of domain
specific computing with open architectures and open source implementations.
What eventually will lead to more [firmware everywhere](../osf-trivia-list/introduction.md#where-is-firmware). Addressing mentioned areas is just
beginning for Dasharo we think following years would need way more firmware
expertise then at any other point in time.
