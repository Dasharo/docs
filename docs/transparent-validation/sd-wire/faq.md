# SDWire Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

## Will the SDWire be compatible with the Odroid-XU4?

The SDWire has been tested on the RTE (Remote Testing Environment) platform with
Orange Pi Zero and GoodRam MicroSDHC 32 GB Class 10 UHS-I/U1.

For usage documentation, please visit SDWire [usage validation](https://docs.dasharo.com/transparent-validation/sd-wire/usage-validation/) 
section.

Please note that the "First use" has already been completed during the pre-sale
validation of the SDWire. However, we haven't conducted compatibility tests on
the Odroid-XU4, so we cannot provide specific details regarding compatibility
with those devices. You can learn more about the RTE platform
[here](https://shop.3mdeb.com/shop/open-source-hardware/rte/).

## Can I use SDWire to download photos from a DSLR camera remotely?

Yes, the product is designed to facilitate remote access and data management for
SD cards, which should work well for your purpose of retrieving photos from a
remote DSLR camera.

## What are the speed limitations, specifically the maximum speed for reading and writing to an SD card?

We conducted a simple test involving multiple attempts to flash an SD card
inserted into SD Wire. The data transfer rates for these successive attempts
ranged between 12 MB/s and 21 MB/s.
