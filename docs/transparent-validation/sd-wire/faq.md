# SDWire Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

## How can I ensure that SDWire is compatible with my system?

The SDWire has been tested on the RTE (Remote Testing Environment) platform with
Orange Pi Zero and GoodRam MicroSDHC 32 GB Class 10 UHS-I/U1. You can learn more
about the RTE platform [here](https://shop.3mdeb.com/shop/open-source-hardware/rte/).

For usage documentation, please visit SDWire [usage validation](https://docs.dasharo.com/transparent-validation/sd-wire/usage-validation/)
section. Please note that the "First use" has already been completed during the
pre-sale validation of the SDWire.

We haven't conducted specific compatibility tests on other platforms, so we
cannot provide detailed information regarding its compatibility with other
devices.

## Can I use SDWire to download photos from a DSLR camera remotely?

Yes, the product is designed to facilitate remote access and data management for
SD cards, which should work well for your purpose of retrieving photos from a
remote DSLR camera.

## What are the speed limitations, specifically the maximum speed for reading and writing to an SD card?

We conducted a simple test involving multiple attempts to flash an SD card
inserted into SD Wire. The data transfer rates for these successive attempts
ranged between 12 MB/s and 21 MB/s.
