# SDWire usage

## Environment preparation

SD-MUX has dedicated software which is a simple tool meant to control the
hardware. Source code of the tool is published on [tizen
git](https://git.tizen.org/cgit/tools/testlab/sd-mux/) server. This is simple to
use, command-line utility software written in C and based on open-source libFTDI
library.

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone git://git.tizen.org/tools/testlab/sd-mux
```

2. Follow the instruction included in sd-mux/README:
```
Requirements:
  1. libftdi1 1.4 - development library
  2. popt - development library
  3. cmake - binary tool

Build:
 - enter into project directory
 - create 'build' directory
 - enter into "build" directory
 - run 'cmake ..'
 - run 'make'

Install:
 - enter into 'build' directory
 - run 'sudo make install' to install binary into '/usr/local/bin' (the default
   one) directory

Note:
If you want to install files into different directory then add argument to cmake
command: `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..`

Then again run:
 make
 make install
```
3. Now the environment is ready to configure and control the SDWire.

## First use

1. Run in the terminal:
```
dmesg -w
```
2. Connect the SDWire to your machine using micro-USB-->USB cable.
3. Your `dmesg` output should looks like this:
```
(...)
[73278.307591] usb-storage 3-1.1:1.0: USB Mass Storage device detected
[73278.307823] scsi host6: usb-storage 3-1.1:1.0
[73278.384925] usb 3-1.2: new full-speed USB device number 45 using xhci_hcd
[73278.492025] usb 3-1.2: New USB device found, idVendor=0403, idProduct=6015, bcdDevice=10.00
[73278.492027] usb 3-1.2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[73278.492028] usb 3-1.2: Product: FT200X USB I2C
[73278.492029] usb 3-1.2: Manufacturer: FTDI
[73278.492030] usb 3-1.2: SerialNumber: DB007V7V
(...)
```

4. Check if SDWire is configured:
```
sudo  sd-mux-ctrl --list
```
If output looks like below, it means that SDWire is configured and ready to use.
From now on, you can go to ["Everyday use"](#everyday-use) section.
```
Number of FTDI devices found: 1
Dev: 0, Manufacturer: SRPOL, Serial: sd-wire_11, Description: sd-wire
```
Otherwise, if output shows no devices (like in the example below):
```
Number of FTDI devices found: 0
```
you have to configure SDWire:
```
sudo sd-mux-ctrl --device-serial=DB007V7V --vendor=0x0403 --product=0x6015 --device-type=sd-wire --set-serial=sd-wire_11
```
where:
```
--device-serial=<SerialNumber> (from dmesg output)

--vendor=0x<idVendor> (from dmesg output)

--product=0x<idProduct> (from dmesg output)

--set-serial=<New serial device>
```

5. Check if SDWire is properly configured:
```
sudo  sd-mux-ctrl --list
```
should output:
```
Number of FTDI devices found: 1
Dev: 0, Manufacturer: SRPOL, Serial: sd-wire_11, Description: sd-wire
```

## Everyday use

### Typical scenario

1. Disconnect power supply from the DUT (Device Under Test).
2. Disconnect micro SD card from the DUT.
3. Connect micro SD card to the TS (Test Server) using card reader.
4. Flash the SD card.
5. Connect SD card to the DUT.
6. Connect power supply to the DUT.
7. Boot DUT from new image.

Using SDWire there is no need to disconnect SD card from DUT.

### Scenario using SDWire and RTE

1. Insert SD card to the SDWire.
1. Insert SDWire into the DUT and connect it to the TS with micro-USB-->USB
   cable.
1. Connect [RTE][shop1] power control connectors to the DUT (RTE here is
   optional, it helps with automated and remote power control of the connected
   device).
1. Check serial no. of SDWire:
```
sudo  sd-mux-ctrl --list
```
Output:
```
Number of FTDI devices found: 1
Dev: 0, Manufacturer: SRPOL, Serial: sd-wire_11, Description: sd-wire
```
1. Disconnect power supply using RTE.
1. Connect SD card to the TS (using sd-mux-ctrl)
```
sudo sd-mux-ctrl --device-serial=sd-wire_11 --ts
```
1. Flash the SD card usign `bmaptool` or balenaEtcher.
1. Connect SD card to the DUT (using sd-mux-ctrl)
```
sudo sd-mux-ctrl --device-serial=sd-wire_11 --ts
```
1. Connect power supply using RTE.
1. DUT should boot from freshly burned SD card.

> Command `sudo sd-mux-ctrl --device-serial=sd-wire_11 --status` returns
information if SDWire is connected to DUT or TS.
```
âžœ  ~ sudo sd-mux-ctrl --device-serial=sd-wire_11 --status
SD connected to: TS
```
At the moment RTE does not support sd-mux-ctrl, so SDWire must be controlled
from configured TS (host computer).

## Presale validation

Hardware requirements:

* SDWire
* SD card
* DUT bootable from SD card (RPI, Orange PI etc.)
* DUT power supply
* Micro-USB-->USB cable

Validation steps:

1. Prepare environment in accordance with this [section](#evnironment-preparation).
1. Insert SD card to the SDWire.
1. Put SDWire into the DUT and connect it to the TS with the micro USB - USB
   cable.
1. Check if SDWire is preconfigured:
```
sudo  sd-mux-ctrl --list
Number of FTDI devices found: 1
Dev: 0, Manufacturer: SRPOL, Serial: sd-wire_11, Description: sd-wire
```
If any FTDI device is found, it means that SDWire is preconfigured, if not - go
to [first use](#first-use) section and prepare the device.
1. Connect SD card to the TS:
```
sudo sd-mux-ctrl --device-serial=sd-wire_11 --ts
```
1. Flash the SD card usign `bmaptool` or balenaEtcher.
1. Connect SD card to the DUT using `sd-mux-ctrl`:
```
sudo sd-mux-ctrl --device-serial=sd-wire_11 --DUT
```
1. Connect power supply to the DUT and check if it boots properly from newly
   burned image.
