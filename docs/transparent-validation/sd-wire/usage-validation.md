# SDWire usage

## Environment preparation

SD-MUX has dedicated software which is a simple tool meant to control the
hardware. Source code of the tool is published on [tizen
git](https://git.tizen.org/cgit/tools/testlab/sd-mux/) server. This is simple to
use, command-line utility software written in C and based on open-source libFTDI
library.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone git://git.tizen.org/tools/testlab/sd-mux
    ```
2. Check whether the installation requirements for sd-mux are met:
    * libftdi1 1.4 development library is installed. To do this, open the 
       terminal and type the following command:
        ```
        dpkg -L libftdi1-dev
        ```
        If library is installed, after typing the above command you will see 
        information about the paths to the library components. 
    * popt development library is installed. To do this, open the terminal and
       type the following command:
        ```
        dpkg -L libftdi1-dev
        ```
        If library is installed, after typing the above command you will see 
        information about the paths to the library components. 
    * cmake binary tool is installed. To do this, open the terminal and type 
       the following command:
        ```
        cmake --version
        ```
        If tool is installed, after typing the above command you will see 
        information about the installed on your computer cmake version. 
    
    If any above-mentioned requirements are not met - go to point 3. If they are
    met - go to point 4. 

3. Install missing libraries and/or tools:
   * libftdi1 1.4 development library. To do this, open the terminal and type 
       the following command: 
        ```
        sudo apt-get install libftdi1-dev
        ```
   * popt development library. To do this, open the terminal and type the
       following command: 
        ```
        sudo apt-get install libpopt-dev
        ```
   * cmake binary tool. To do this, open the terminal and type the following 
        command:  
        ```
        sudo apt-get install cmake
        ```

5. Enter into sd-mux project directory and reproduce the following steps to 
    build project:
    * open directory in terminal.
    * create 'build' directory by the following command:
    * enter into 'build' directory by the following command:
    * run the following commands one by one:
        ```
        cmake ..
        make
        ```

6. In above-desribed directory run the following command to binary:
    ```
    sudo make install
    ```
    Note, that above-desribed command install binary into '/usr/local/bin' (the 
    default one) directory. If you want to install files into different directory 
    then add argument to cmakecommand: 'cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..'. 
    Then it is obligatory to run agint the following commands:
    ```
    make
    make install
    ```

## First use

1. Run in the terminal:
```
dmesg -w
```
2. Connect the SDWire to your machine using micro-USB-->USB cable.
3. Your `dmesg` output should looks like this:
```
(...)
[73278.307591] usb-storage 3-1.1:1.0: USB Mass Storage device detected
[73278.307823] scsi host6: usb-storage 3-1.1:1.0
[73278.384925] usb 3-1.2: new full-speed USB device number 45 using xhci_hcd
[73278.492025] usb 3-1.2: New USB device found, idVendor=0403, idProduct=6015, bcdDevice=10.00
[73278.492027] usb 3-1.2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[73278.492028] usb 3-1.2: Product: FT200X USB I2C
[73278.492029] usb 3-1.2: Manufacturer: FTDI
[73278.492030] usb 3-1.2: SerialNumber: DB007V7V
(...)
```

4. Check if SDWire is configured:
```
sudo  sd-mux-ctrl --list
```
If output looks like below, it means that SDWire is configured and ready to use.
From now on, you can go to ["Everyday use"](#everyday-use) section.
```
Number of FTDI devices found: 1
Dev: 0, Manufacturer: SRPOL, Serial: sd-wire_11, Description: sd-wire
```
Otherwise, if output shows no devices (like in the example below):
```
Number of FTDI devices found: 0
```
you have to configure SDWire:
```
sudo sd-mux-ctrl --device-serial=DB007V7V --vendor=0x0403 --product=0x6015 --device-type=sd-wire --set-serial=sd-wire_11
```
where:
```
--device-serial=<SerialNumber> (from dmesg output)

--vendor=0x<idVendor> (from dmesg output)

--product=0x<idProduct> (from dmesg output)

--set-serial=<New serial device>
```

5. Check if SDWire is properly configured:
```
sudo  sd-mux-ctrl --list
```
should output:
```
Number of FTDI devices found: 1
Dev: 0, Manufacturer: SRPOL, Serial: sd-wire_11, Description: sd-wire
```

## Everyday use typical scenario

1. Disconnect power supply from the DUT (Device Under Test).
2. Disconnect micro SD card from the DUT.
3. Connect micro SD card to the TS (Test Server) using card reader.
4. Flash the SD card.
5. Connect SD card to the DUT.
6. Connect power supply to the DUT.
7. Boot DUT from new image.

Using SDWire there is no need to disconnect SD card from DUT.

## Scenario when SDWire and RTE are in use

1. Insert SD card to the SDWire.
2. Insert SDWire into the DUT and connect it to the TS with micro-USB-->USB
   cable.
3. Connect [RTE][shop1] power control connectors to the DUT (RTE here is
   optional, it helps with automated and remote power control of the connected
   device).
4. Check serial no. of SDWire:
```
sudo  sd-mux-ctrl --list
```
Output:
```
Number of FTDI devices found: 1
Dev: 0, Manufacturer: SRPOL, Serial: sd-wire_11, Description: sd-wire
```
5. Disconnect power supply using RTE.
6. Connect SD card to the TS (using sd-mux-ctrl)
```
sudo sd-mux-ctrl --device-serial=sd-wire_11 --ts
```
7. Flash the SD card usign `bmaptool` or balenaEtcher.
8. Connect SD card to the DUT (using sd-mux-ctrl)
```
sudo sd-mux-ctrl --device-serial=sd-wire_11 --ts
```
9. Connect power supply using RTE.
10. DUT should boot from freshly burned SD card.

> Command `sudo sd-mux-ctrl --device-serial=sd-wire_11 --status` returns
information if SDWire is connected to DUT or TS.
```
âžœ  ~ sudo sd-mux-ctrl --device-serial=sd-wire_11 --status
SD connected to: TS
```
At the moment RTE does not support sd-mux-ctrl, so SDWire must be controlled
from configured TS (host computer).

## Presale validation

Hardware requirements:

* SDWire
* SD card
* DUT bootable from SD card (RPI, Orange PI etc.)
* DUT power supply
* Micro-USB-->USB cable

Validation steps:

1. Prepare environment in accordance with this [section](#evnironment-preparation).
2. Insert SD card to the SDWire.
3. Put SDWire into the DUT and connect it to the TS with the micro USB - USB
   cable.
4. Check if SDWire is preconfigured:
```
sudo  sd-mux-ctrl --list
Number of FTDI devices found: 1
Dev: 0, Manufacturer: SRPOL, Serial: sd-wire_11, Description: sd-wire
```
If any FTDI device is found, it means that SDWire is preconfigured, if not - go
to [first use](#first-use) section and prepare the device.
5. Connect SD card to the TS:
```
sudo sd-mux-ctrl --device-serial=sd-wire_11 --ts
```
6. Flash the SD card usign `bmaptool` or balenaEtcher.
7. Connect SD card to the DUT using `sd-mux-ctrl`:
```
sudo sd-mux-ctrl --device-serial=sd-wire_11 --DUT
```
8. Connect power supply to the DUT and check if it boots properly from newly
   burned image.
