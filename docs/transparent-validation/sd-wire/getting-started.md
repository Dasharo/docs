SD-Wire is a small board with 2 features:

* SD card reader
* SD card MUX

There is only one micro USB socket for connecting to host PC.
Both USB mass storage and MUX control are served through the
same USB connection.

The PCB board is designed in such way that it fits into micro SD
card slots. Thanks to this, there is no need for special cables
with micro SD adapter and connection to SD slot on a device is very short.
