SD-Wire is a small board with two features:

* SD card reader
* SD card MUX

Sd-Wire allows to flash SD card connected to the DUT
(Device Under Test), without physical contact with the device.
There is only one micro USB socket for connecting to host PC.
Both USB mass storage and MUX control are served through the
same USB connection.

The PCB board is designed in such way that it fits into micro SD
card slots. Thanks to this, there is no need for special cables
with a micro SD adapter.
