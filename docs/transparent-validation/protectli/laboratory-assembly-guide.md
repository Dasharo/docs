### External flashing enabling

=== "VP2410"

    External flashing not possible with Pomona clip, the flash chip lies under
    the chassis, which serves the cooling purposes. One option is to drill a
    hole in the case where the flash chip lies.

=== "VP2420"

    External flashing not possible with Pomona clip, the flash chip lies under
    the SODIMM module.

=== "VP4630/VP4650/VP4670"

    Flash chip is socketed. One has to desolder the socket, solder the flash
    chip in place of the socket and connect the Pomona SOIC8 clip.

=== "V1210/V1410/V1610"

    Connect the RTE SPI header to the platform using the 2.54mm female-female
    wires as described in the table:

    | RTE SPI header      | 6pin flash header                      |
    |:-------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
    | J7 pin 1 (Vcc)      | <TBD marking> pin 1 (SPI Power)        |
    | J7 pin 2 (GND)      | <TBD marking> pin 2 (GND)              |
    | J7 pin 3 (CS)       | <TBD marking> pin 4 (BIOS SPI CS pin)  |
    | J7 pin 4 (SCLK)     | <TBD marking> pin 6 (SPI Clock)        |
    | J7 pin 5 (MISO)     | <TBD marking> pin 5 (MISO)             |

## Theory of operation

The following sections describe how to use all of the enabled features:

* serial connection to the platform,
* controlling power supply,
* enabling basic power actions with the platform (power off/power on/reset),
* external flashing with the RTE,
* CMOS reset.

### Serial connection

The method of setting and using serial connection is described in the
[Serial connection guide](../rte/v1.1.0/serial-port-connection-guide.md).

### Power supply controlling

=== "VP2410"

    Power supply controlling is performed with the relay module on RTE
    connected to one of RTE GPIOs. Power operation should be performed using
    the `rte_ctrl` script implemented in `meta-rte` (OS image dedicated to the
    RTE platform).

    To toggle the power supply use the below command:

        ```bash
        rte_ctrl rel
        ```

=== "VP2420"

    Power supply controlling is performed with the relay module on RTE
    connected to one of RTE GPIOs. Power operation should be performed using
    the `rte_ctrl` script implemented in `meta-rte` (OS image dedicated to the
    RTE platform).

    To toggle the power supply use the below command:

        ```bash
        rte_ctrl rel
        ```

=== "VP4630/VP4650/VP4670"

    Power supply controlling (in this case: controlling the state of Sonoff)
    should be performed based on the `sonoff.sh` script implemented in
    `meta-rte` (OS image dedicated to the RTE platform).

    > Note, that before using the above-mentioned script, it should be modified and
    `SONOFF_IP` parameter should be set in accordance with obtained Sonoff IP address.

    To perform basic power operations use the below-described commands:

    1. Turn on the power supply:

        ```bash
        ./sonoff on
        ```

    2. Turn off the power supply:

        ```bash
        ./sonoff on
        ```

=== "V1210/V1410/V1610"

    Power supply controlling is performed with the relay module on RTE
    connected to one of RTE GPIOs. Power operation should be performed using
    the `rte_ctrl` script implemented in `meta-rte` (OS image dedicated to the
    RTE platform).

    To toggle the power supply use the below command:

        ```bash
        rte_ctrl rel
        ```

### Basic power operations

Basic power operations should be performed based on the `rte_ctrl` script
implemented in `meta-rte` (OS image dedicated to the RTE platform). To perform
basic power operations use the below-described commands:

1. Turn on the platform:

    ```bash
    rte_ctrl pon
    ```

1. Turn off the platform:

    ```bash
    rte_ctrl poff
    ```

1. Reset the platform:

    ```bash
    rte_ctrl reset
    ```

> Note, that in order for the above commands to work properly, the platform
should be powered up: both Sonoff and the power supply must be turned on.

### External flashing

The external flashing procedure should be performed based on the scripts
implemented on the RTE platform. To perform the flashing operation reproduce,
the below-described steps:

1. By using `scp` put the requested Dasharo file to the RTE:

    ```bash
    scp <path_to_firmware>/<firmware_file> root@<RTE_IP>:/tmp/coreboot.rom
    ```

    Where:

    - `path_to_firmware` - path to firmware, which should send to RTE,
    - `firmware_file` - the name of the firmware file, which should be sent
        to RTE,
    - `RTE_IP` - IP address of the connected RTE.

1. Login to RTE via `ssh` or `minicom`.
1. Read the flash chip by executing the following command on RTE:

    ```bash
    ./flash.sh read tmp/dump.rom
    ```

1. If the reading was successful, the output from the command above should
    contain the phrase `Verifying flash... VERIFIED`.
1. Write the flash chip by executing the following command on RTE:

    ```bash
    ./flash.sh write /tmp/coreboot.rom
    ```

    > Do not interrupt the flashing procedure in any way (especially by
    changing connections). It may cause hardware damage!

1. If the reading was successful, the output from the command above should
    contain the phrase `Verifying flash... VERIFIED`.

### CMOS clear

To clear the CMOS, turn off the power with Sonoff or relay and use the
following commands:

```bash
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio412/value
sleep 10
echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio412/value
```
