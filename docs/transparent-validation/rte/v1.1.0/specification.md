The micro USB connector (`J17`) is a USB B micro socket for powering up RTE and
OrangePi Zero setup. It is required to use a 5V/2A power adapter. There is no
difference whether the user plugs the power supply to the micro USB connector
located on RTE board or use OrangePi Zero original socket.

### Reset button

Reset button (`SW1`) located near relay is used for resetting the RTE itself.

## How to set GPIO states to flash SPI?

1. Set proper SPI Vcc Voltage:

    Adequate Vcc voltege is neccesary for succesfull flash procedure. If it will
    be to low chip will not recognize any signals, if too high chip will be
    damaged.

    ```bash
    echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio405/value
    ```

    Or when flash chip operates on 3.3V:

    ```bash
    echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio405/value
    ```

1. Enable SPI Vcc:

    ```bash
    echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio406/value
    ```

1. Enable SPI signals:

    ```bash
    echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio404/value
    ```

1. Flash SPI chip:

    ```bash
    flashrom -w /path/to/coreboot.rom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=16000
    ```

1. When done, change back all states:

    ```bash
    echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio405/value

    echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio406/value

    echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio404/value
    ```
