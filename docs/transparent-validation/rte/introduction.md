# RTE Introduction

**RTE** is
[certified Open Source Hardware](https://certification.oshwa.org/pl000003.html),
so based on published
[schematics](https://github.com/3mdeb/rte-schematics)
you can build and modify PCB yourself.

**RTE** is a hat designed for Orange Pi Zero board which runs specially crafted
Linux distribution using the Yocto Project. RTE boards are used for controlling
**Device Under Test** fully remotely through the network interface. Most common
applications are:

* debugging tasks,
* flashing firmware,
* controlling GPIOs
* power management for **Device Under Test**.
