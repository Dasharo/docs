## Why should you add requests to Jira Service Management?

JSM allows you to easily keep track of the status of individual requests. Each
new request you add means analysis and pricing of task execution. This
conversation will take place on JSM. Progress on the request will also be
reported using JSM.

## Before you raise your first request

Remember to provide a list of email addresses of people that need access to the
portal. It's required to prepare the organization, where requested people will
automatically receive updates on the ticket statuses.

## How to add a request

### Raising requests using the portal

To add a new request using the web service:

1. Go to [portal](https://jira-3mdeb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
   and select the project.
2. Select a type of request and provide the required data. You can also add
   attachments by dragging and dropping them into any part of the web page, or
   by clicking the `Browse` button.
3. When you are ready to send the request, click Send. Your request is created
   and awaits our response.

### Raising requests using email

If you prefer raising a request using email, you can do this by sending a
message to special email address generated for the project.

The email address will be provided to you by separate message.

### Communication through the Jira Service Desk

You can always add a comment to the request and attach files. You can do it
directly from the JSM request page or using email simply by replying to the
email thread.

We'll also add comments, questions and quotations in the comment section.

### What happens after you raise a request

We'll soon let you know about the cost and what solutions are proposed. You'll
also receive information on which requests will be resolved in the next release.

## Process and request statuses

The diagram below presents what the workflow of JSM requests looks like.
