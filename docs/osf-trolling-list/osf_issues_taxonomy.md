Open Source Firmware Trolling Topics List (OSFTTL)
--------------------------------------------------

Name of this list was chosen purposefully and facetiously, because its goal is
to confront opinions of various community members about controversial topics.
We know those topics sometime cause "flame wars" or at least rise the
temperature of discussion, but we think it is important to have a base onA
which Open Source Firmware community can move forward and evolve instead
rambling on basic stuff which was already addressed in other places and
discussions.

Other role of this list is to create taxonomy of OSF problems and issues to
community and Dasharo customers, to avoid repeating argumentation and
explanation of topics which most of community already are familiar with.
