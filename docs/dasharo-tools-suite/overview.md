## Overview

Dasharo Tools Suite (DTS) is a set of tools running in a minimal Linux
environment to deploy, update, and maintain firmware on Dasharo-supported
devices. For example, it can be used to update the firmware on a device or run
the initial deployment, even when no OS is currently installed.

* [Releases](releases.md) - groups information about all releases.
* [Documentation](documentation.md) - describes DTS functionality and
    information on how to run it.
