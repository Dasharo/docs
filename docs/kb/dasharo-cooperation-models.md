## Dasharo Relationship Types

Dasharo engages with a diverse client base through distinct relationship
models, which are classified primarily as individual or business. This
classification is crucial for ensuring that the services and support provided
are aligned with the usage and needs of each client category.

### Individual Relations

Individual users of Dasharo are those who engage with the product for personal
use. The criteria for classification as an individual user are:

1. **Personal Use Only:** The usage of Dasharo firmware is strictly for
   personal, non-commercial activities. This includes the installation and use
of the firmware on personal devices without any direct financial gain or
business activities derived from its utilization.
1. **Device Limit:** The individual user is permitted to use the Dasharo
   firmware on a maximum of five devices within the same market segment, such
as network appliances, laptops, desktops, workstation or servers.

Failure to meet these criteria automatically reclassifies a user into the
business category, necessitating adherence to the corresponding business terms
and conditions.

### Business Relations

Clients who fall outside the individual criteria are categorized as business
users. This includes:

1. **Commercial Use:** Any use of Dasharo firmware that involves commercial
   activities, such as integrating the firmware into products or services that
are subsequently sold to third parties, qualifies as commercial use.
1. **Exceeding Device Limit:** Using Dasharo firmware on more than five devices
   in the same market segment, regardless of the intent, transitions the user
to a business relationship status.
1. **Corporate Entities:** Any organization, corporation, or business entity
   that utilizes Dasharo firmware as part of its operational infrastructure is
recognized as a business client. This classification is independent of the
number of devices used.

Business clients are required to engage with Dasharo through more structured
agreements such described further in this document.
