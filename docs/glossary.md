Glossary
--------

After years of providing services and products on firmware
market we recognize that it is poisoned by incorrect and
confusing terminology. In following glossary we would like to
explain most used terms from Dasharo Documentation. We try to
refer to standards, literature and community best practices to
keep content added by us minimalistic.

## Embedded Firmware

We use definition explained in first chapter of
["Embedded Firmware Solutions"](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484200711) book
by Jiming Sun, Marc Jones, Stefan Reinauer and Vincent Zimmer.

Firmware is "layer of software between the hardware and the
operating system (OS), with the main purpose to initialize and
abstract enough hardware so that the operating systems and
their drivers can further configure the hardware to its full
functionality."

Rising complexity of hardware initialization and need for its
manageability created need for BMC (Board Management
Controllers), EC (Environmental Controllers) and even more
specialized one like USB Power Delivery firmware. What may
make that firmware also covered by above definition.
