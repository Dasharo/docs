# Ways you can help us

Please consider the following methods to support us if you value what we are
doing.

## Join Dasharo Matrix Community

We have created Matrix Dasharo Space, an open-source online community, inviting
you to join us. Matrix Dasharo Space is a place where you can find solutions to
many problems, and if not - our community will gladly help you. We encourage you
to troubleshoot your open-source firmware issues there.

Here is invitation [link](https://matrix.to/#/#dasharo:matrix.org).

Inside you will find multiple rooms. The main discussion happens in "Dasharo -
General".

## Join Dasharo Beta Testing Group

Dasharo Beta Testing Group is a group of users who help make Dasharo better. They
are willing to flash their devicies with Release Candidates (RC) firmware binaries
and provide test results by reporting issues or confirming fixes.

Members of this community will have access to invite-only Dasharo Space channel,
where calls for testing for the particular, RC versions of firmwares will be
announced.

If you want to join the community, please send an
[e-mail](mailto:contact@dasharo.com?subject=DasharoBeta) with following information:

1. Matrix nickname
2. Which Dasharo supported device(s) you are willing to test

## Join Dasharo open-source firmware vPub

We encourage you to join us at our vPub parties, which we hold 3-4x / year in
"Dasharo OSF vPub." vPub is an alternative to live meeting for those who can't
or don't want to meet live. It also served as salvation in times of COVID-19.
Our goal is to have a platform for open-source firmware, open-source hardware,
and open instruction set architectures discussion in a casual atmosphere.

For more information please visit [event website](https://vpub.dasharo.com).

### BTC and other crypto coins

Our company does not currently support payment in cryptocurrencies.

While we understand that cryptocurrencies have gained popularity and recognition
in recent years, we have chosen to retain our focus on conventional payment
channels.

Firstly, we prioritize financial compliance and adhere to EU regulations.
Managing cryptocurrencies would require extensive knowledge and resources to
ensure compliance, which we are not equipped to handle at our current stage of
development. Moreover, the uncertain and evolving nature of cryptocurrency
regulations introduces significant risks and potential vulnerabilities. These
factors could potentially lead to fiscal audits that could hamper the operations
of 3mdeb and impede the progress of Dasharo development.

We believe that by adhering to established payment methods, we can ensure a
consistent and reliable payment process for our customers. This allows us to
maintain a high level of security, accountability, and regulatory compliance.
