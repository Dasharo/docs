# Ways you can help us

Please consider the following methods to support us if you value what we are
doing.

## Join Dasharo Matrix Community

We have created Matrix Dasharo Space, an open-source online community, inviting
you to join us. Matrix Dasharo Space is a place where you can find solutions to
many problems, and if not - our community will gladly help you. We encourage you
to troubleshoot your open-source firmware issues there.

Here is invitation [link](https://matrix.to/#/#dasharo:matrix.org).

Inside you will find multiple rooms. The main discussion happens in "Dasharo -
General".

## Join Dasharo open-source firmware vPub

We encourage you to join us at our vPub parties, which we hold 3-4x / year in
"Dasharo OSF vPub." vPub is an alternative to live meeting for those who can't
or don't want to meet live. It also served as salvation in times of COVID-19.
Our goal is to have a platform for open-source firmware, open-source hardware,
and open instruction set architectures discussion in a casual atmosphere.

For more information please visit [event website](https://vpub.dasharo.com).
