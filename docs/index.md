      include a variety of discussions on different topics related to Dasharo.

      environment where participants can share knowledge and ideas, connect with
      others in the industry, and learn about the latest developments in the
      field. The conversations can range from technical challenges faced by
      developers, off-topic discussions, to new features or improvements. These
      events have brought together experts and enthusiasts from all over the
      world, providing valuable opportunities for learning, collaboration, and
      networking. Everything in casual atmosphere with beverage of your choice in
