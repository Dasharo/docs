# Versioning

Dasharo Releases are versioned using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
and [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) to document
changes introduced in new releases.

Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development and may not support all
Dasharo Quality Criteria.

The only way to map Dasharo Version to version of Open Source Firmware
framework or other components included in Dasharo Release is through release
notes. Link to Dasharo Release Notes for your hardware platform can be found in
[Hardware Compatibility List](../variants/hardware-compatibility-list.md)
section.
