## Description

Dasharo's naming scheme is crafted to convey the essential details of each
firmware package. It includes the base firmware framework, an optional payload,
the targeted market segment, and the customer type. This structure assists in
identifying the most suitable package for specific technological needs, market
segments, and customer categories.

Components of the naming scheme:

```plain

market_segment
```

- `firmware_framework`: Mandatory. Specifies the base firmware framework used
  in the package. Available options:

    [coreboot](https://coreboot.org) open source project.
    + `UEFI` - [Dasharo downstream](https://github.com/Dasharo/edk2) of
    [Tianocore EDK II](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) reference
