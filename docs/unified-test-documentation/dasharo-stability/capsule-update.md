## CUP001.001 Capsule Update With Wrong Keys (UEFI Shell)

**Test description**

This test aims to verify that the Device Under Test (DUT) rejects flashing a
capsule that is signed with an invalid certificate.

Each step in this test case should be executed in accordance with the
instructions given in our
[Capsule Update documentation](../../guides/capsule-update.md).

**Test configuration data**

1. `FIRMWARE` = Dasharo

**Test setup**

1. Ensure the DUT is connected and the UEFI shell is available.
1. Proceed with the common test setup steps as described in the
   [Test cases common documentation](#test-cases-common-documentation) section.

**Test steps**

1. Obtain and save the current BIOS version as `${original_bios_version}`.
1. Perform a capsule update using an invalid certificate file
1. Reboot the system and select the UEFI Shell boot option.
1. After the system boots, verify the BIOS version and save it as
   `${updated_bios_version}`.
1. Check that the BIOS version has not changed by verifying that
   `${original_bios_version}` is equal to `${updated_bios_version}`.
1. Verify that there is a status note about a security violation.

**Expected result**

1. The BIOS version should not change after attempting the capsule update.
1. The status should contain a note indicating that the update was rejected due
