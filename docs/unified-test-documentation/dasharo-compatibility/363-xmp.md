# Dasharo Compatibility: Memory Profile Switching

## MPS003.001 Booting at XMP profile 1

This test aims to verify that XMP profile #1 is functional and that the DUT is
able to train memory at the settings specified by the XMP profile.

> XMP is an overclocking feature. The outcome of this test is inherently
> dependent on the DIMM modules tested as well as the silicon quality of the CPU
> itself.
