## SHT001.001 SATA hot plug (firmware)

**Test description**

This test aims to verify that the disk connected to the SATA port could be
detected after hot-plug.

**Test configuration data**

1. `FIRMWARE` = Dasharo

**Test setup**

1. Proceed with the
   [Test cases common documentation](#test-cases-common-documentation) section.
1. Any operating system should be installed on the SATA disk.

**Test steps**

1. Power on the DUT.
1. Hold the `BOOT_MENU_KEY` to enter the UEFI Boot Menu.
1. Select the `UEFI Shell` option using the arrow keys and press `Enter`.
1. Execute the following command in the shell:

    ```bash
    map -t hd
    ```

1. Note the results.
1. Connect the disk to the SATA port.
1. Execute the following command in the shell:

    ```bash
    map -t hd -r
    ```

**Expected result**

1. The output of the first command should contain mapping table for all hard
    disks connected to the device.
1. The output of the second command should contain refreshed mapping table for
    all hard disks connected to the device.
1. The refreshed list should contain additional item - mounted SATA disk.
