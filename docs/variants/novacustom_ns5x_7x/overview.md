## Firmware

Each firmware release contains of two parts:

- [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS) firmware,
- [EC (Embedded Controller)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_controller)
  firmware.

They both interact with each other tightly, so keeping their compatible versions
in in sync is important. Information on compatiblity should be always explained
in the [release page](releases.md).
