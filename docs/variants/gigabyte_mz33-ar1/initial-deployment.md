# Initial deployment

This document describes the process of building, installing and running
flashrom on Ubuntu 24.04.

## Build flashrom

Please follow generic guide for [Dasharo flashrom fork](../../osf-trivia-list/deployment.md#how-to-install-dasharo-flashrom-fork).

## Reading flash contents

Always prepare a backup of the current firmware image. To read from the flash
and save it to a file (`dump.rom`), execute the following command:

```bash
flashrom -p internal -r dump.rom
```

## Flashing Dasharo

To flash Dasharo on the platform, it is only possible with an external
programmer currently. Follow the same process as in [recovery
section](recovery.md).
