Hardkernel ODROID-H4 PLUS is a small single-board computer with publicly
available schematics and documentation. One of it's most noteworthy features is the
use of two distinct switchable BIOS flash memory chips. This makes it a perfect
device for experimenting with firmware by making the recovery process after
bricking the device a breeze.

The device is described in detail on [blog.3mdeb.com](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2024/2024-07-25-odroid-h4-getting-started/)

The Hardkernel ODROID-H4 PLUS is available as part of the [Dasharo Pro Package](https://shop.3mdeb.com/shop/dasharo-pro-package/1-year-dasharo-entry-subscription-for-network-appliance/).
