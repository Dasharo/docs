[PC Engines](https://www.pcengines.ch/) is a Swiss-based company that
specializes in the design and manufacture of small form factor computer
hardware, including single-board computers (SBCs), network appliances, and
embedded systems. Their products are often used in networking,
telecommunications, security applications, in-home automation, and other
industrial applications.

PC Engines is particularly well-known for its low-power, high-performance SBCs,
including the APU (Accelerated Processing Unit) series, which feature AMD G-series
embedded processors, and the ALIX series, based on the AMD Geode processor.
These SBCs are commonly used as firewalls, routers, and other network
appliances.

PC Engines is a well-recognized brand in the open-source community mostly
because of full [schematics availability (apu2d
example)](https://www.pcengines.ch/schema/apu2d.pdf) and use of [open-source
firmware](https://pcengines.github.io/). PC Engines products are top-rated
among pfSense and OPNsense users. What you can see based on the number of forum
topics regarding apu platforms.

## Status

In 2016, PC Engines contracted 3mdeb to take over the maintenance of
open-source firmware for PC Engines products. Development happened in [PC
Engines Github organization](https://github.com/pcengines) until September
2022, when PC Engines decided to discontinue its sponsorship for open-source
firmware. Dasharo Team is working on creating a sustainable path forward for PC
Engines.' open-source firmware through a subscription and donation model. For
more details, please check [Post EOL firmware
announcement](post-eol-fw-announcement.md), contact us
[directly](mailto:contact@dasharo.com) or through [community
chat](https://matrix.to/#/#dasharo:matrix.org). In 2024, the 3mdeb Dasharo Team
was able to bring back PC Engines firmware in the form of Dasharo
Pro/Enterprise Package (formerly known as Dasharo Entry Subscription) in two
flavors [Dasharo
(coreboot+SeaBIOS)](https://shop.3mdeb.com/shop/dasharo-entry-subscription/1-year-dasharo-entry-subscription-for-network-appliance-corebootseabios/)
and [Dasharo
(coreboot+UEFI)](https://shop.3mdeb.com/shop/dasharo-entry-subscription/1-year-dasharo-entry-subscription-for-network-appliance/).
