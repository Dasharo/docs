## What is the next BIOS version I can install on my APU2 with a Dasharo (coreboot+SeaBIOS) Entry Subscription?

The next BIOS version for your APU2 motherboard under the Dasharo
(coreboot+SeaBIOS) Entry Subscription has not yet been determined. We plan to
conduct tests on pfSense and will likely use the latest stable version available
at the time of testing.
