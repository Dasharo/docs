## What BIOS Version can I install with my Dasharo (coreboot+SeaBIOS) Subscription on an apu2/3/4/6 motherboard?

When you subscribe to a Dasharo (coreboot+SeaBIOS) Entry Subscription for
Network Appliance, the BIOS version updates available to you are determined by
Dasharo's release cycle and testing scope.

1. **Upcoming BIOS Version:**
The next BIOS version that you will be able to install will most likely be
tagged as 24.02.01.01. There is a possibility that this might shift to base on
coreboot 24.05, then it would be called 24.05.01, due to the recent change in
the coreboot versioning scheme. For detailed insights into the versioning
scheme, please refer to the coreboot release notes here: [Coreboot Release Notes](https://doc.coreboot.org/releases/coreboot-24.02-relnotes.html?highlight=releases#release-number-format-update)
as well as discussion about [Dasharo Versioning](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/762).

1. **Test Scope:**
While the exact test scope for the upcoming BIOS version is currently being
finalized, it will offer feature parity with version 4.19.0.1. The test scope
for version 4.19.0.1, which might give you an idea of what to expect, can be
found in this document: [Dasharo Test Scope Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_uRhVo9eYeZONnelymonYp444zYHT_Q_qmJEJ8_XqJc/edit#gid=0).

1. **Release Information:**
Detailed information about the release, including the scope and enhancements,
will be communicated through our release newsletter. Additionally, all release
notes and relevant updates will be made available on the Dasharo documentation
site at [Dasharo Release Documentation](https://docs.dasharo.com/variants/pc_engines/releases_seabios/).

## How much would it cost me to switch my subscription for Network Appliance from already purchased (coreboot+UEFI) to (coreboot+SeaBIOS)?

We can switch your subscription from [Dasharo (coreboot+UEFI) Entry Subscription
for Network Appliance](https://shop.3mdeb.com/shop/dasharo-entry-subscription/1-year-dasharo-entry-subscription-for-network-appliance/)
to the [Dasharo (coreboot+SeaBIOS) Entry Subscription for Network Appliance](https://shop.3mdeb.com/shop/dasharo-entry-subscription/1-year-dasharo-entry-subscription-for-network-appliance-corebootseabios/)
at no extra cost. This change can be made until the end of May, but only if the
purchase was made before the official [(coreboot+UEFI) release](https://docs.dasharo.com/variants/pc_engines/releases_uefi/)
which occurred on 2024-04-02.

If you are interested, please contact us at shopping@3mdeb.com and provide your
