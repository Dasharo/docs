# Firmware Update

As of now, there is no internal update process in Dasharo (coreboot+UEFI) for
QEMU Q35 platform, but [it is on our wish-list](../../projects/capsule-updates.md).
Until then, Dasharo firmware can be updated by invoking a QEMU command with a
newer file in the same way as described in [Dasharo initial deployment](initial-deployment.md).
