# Dasharo Firewall

## About

A firewall is a system that aims to secure your network, controlling the
traffic flow, that is why Dasharo Firewall aims at securing the connection
between applications or devices. It brings the benefits of the Open Source
Firmware to the platform: giving you the source code control, updates, and bug
fixes at any time for better performance and security. Designed for embedded
platforms that are cloud, network-based, or edge computing solutions.
Experience the quality of networking firmware closed in a fine binary with
constant support, maintenance and transparency. For whom: For people who look
for a secure firewall solution based on open-source software and technologies.

TBD: we need more precise characteristics of Dasharo Firewall, it should be
defined by tests we applying to typical firewall devices e.g. OPNsense
compatibility.
TBD: maybe also add some picture/diagram of Dasharo Firewall to compliment the text.
