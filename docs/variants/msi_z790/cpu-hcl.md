# CPU HCL

## Contributing

Feel free to test different processors and report your results via
[email](mailto:contact@dasharo.com) or submit a Pull Request to
[Dasharo documentation repository](https://github.com/Dasharo/docs) or by using
[Dasharo issues repository](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues).

If you already submitted your results and then changed your hardware
configuration, we would appreciate an additional HCL report.

## HCL list

CPU Hardware Compatibility List presents the CPUs tested and verified
to work with Dasharo by community. The following list does not include CPU
which is tested and verfied in 3mdeb laboratory - this information can be
found in [Hardware Matrix](hardware-matrix.md) documentation.

Legend:

* Processor name: the full name of processor including brand and model number.
* Core name: CPU core codename.
* CPU base speed: base CPU speed.
* CPU boost speed: boosted CPU speed.
* Wattage: TDP as declared by the manufacturer.
* GPU: information about integrated graphics processing unit.
* Results: link to test results.

Information about processor name, core name and speed can be read from the OS
(Linux systems - command `lscpu`, Windows systems - `System information` menu).
Rest of the information can be read from CPU package or documentation.
