## v1.0.0 - TBD

### EC firmware transition

Please note, that version 1.0.0 of `Dasharo BIOS firmware` works correctly
**only** with the `Dasharo EC firmware`. This is the first release when this
open-source EC firmware is used, so additional steps need to be taken when
upgrading.

Please refer to the [Firmware update](firmware-update.md) section for more
details on upgrading your firmware.
