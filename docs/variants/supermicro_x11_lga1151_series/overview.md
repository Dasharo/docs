If you want to build, initially deploy, update or recover your setup please
check documentation sections on the left.

## Status

Dasharo compatible with Supermicro X11 LGA1151 Series is a community-driven
effort.  We work on this in our free time, since we have no sponsor for this
project. To address the issue we organize virtual hackathon called [Dasharo
Tuesday](https://3mdeb.com/events/) on Dasharo Matrix almost every Tuesday. If
you are interested in this project, you can consider joining the event or
[supporting us in other way](../../ways-you-can-help-us.md).

The most advanced code is on [development branch](). This code supports only
`Dasharo (coreboot+UEFI)`. Work in progress documentation can be found
[here]().
