## Dell OptiPlex 7010/9010 SFF

Dell OptiPlex 7010/9010 SFF is a small SOHO desktop computer, sometimes used
as a
[firewall or NAS](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelabsales/comments/uzspg3/comment/iadcyb6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

If you wish to build, perform initial deployment, update or recover your setup,
please refer to [documentation](#documentation) sections.

To learn more about our process and motivation for the coreboot port and
Dasharo support, see [references](#references) section.

## History

Dasharo compatible with Dell OptiPlex 7010/9010 used to be a community-driven
effort. We would work on this in our free time, since we had no sponsor for
this project. To address the issue we used to host a virtual hackathon called
[OptiPlex Tuesday](https://3mdeb.com/events/) on Dasharo Matrix, almost every
Tuesday.

With the release of Dasharo firmware for this platform, the event series is
concluded. We would like to thank all participants, and we hope we'll meet
again at future events.
