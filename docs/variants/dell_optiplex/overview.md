# Overview

<!--

_**TBD**: this page should contain most important information about Dasharo OSF
support for Dell OptiPlex 7010/9010 including presentations, demos, external
resources, reviews etc. Currently it just points to subsecations of the
documentation._

-->

Dasharo compatible with Dell OptiPlex 7010/9010 is a community-driven effort.
We work on this in our free time, since we have no sponsor for this project. To
address the issue we organize [virtual hackathon](https://3mdeb.com/events/) on
Dasharo Matrix almost every Tuesday. If you are interesteded in this project,
you can consider joining the event or [supporting us in other
way](../../ways-you-can-help-us.md).

The most advanced code is on
[rel_v0.1.0 branch](https://github.com/Dasharo/coreboot/pull/202) and the most
advanced documentation is [here](https://github.com/Dasharo/docs/pull/139).
This code supports only `Dasharo (coreboot+SeaBIOS)`, so legacy boot. UEFI is
also quite ready, but we need to release `v0.1.0` properly first.
