# Test matrix

## About

The test matrix is used to determine the scope of tests which the DUT is
subjected from before the release of the new binary.

Please refer to the [tests results repository](https://github.com/Dasharo/osfv-results/tree/main/boards/NovaCustom/MTL_14th_Gen/NUC_BOX/).
You can preview the testing scope for upcoming releases and see the results for
releases which already have been tested.
