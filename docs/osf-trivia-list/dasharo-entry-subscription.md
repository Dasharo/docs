## How can I download the Dasharo Entry Subscription binaries?

If you've purchased the Dasharo Entry Subscription, you should have received an
email containing all the necessary details to access your binaries. Here's how
you can download them:

1. **Locate Your Email:** Check the email account you used to purchase the
   subscription. Look for an email from Dasharo that includes your subscription
   data. This email will contain several vital pieces of information:

   - **Logs Key:** A key you might need for other operations or support.
   - **Download Key:** A unique string that allows you to access the download area.
   - **Password:** The password you'll need to access the files.
   - **Expiration Date:** The date until your subscription is valid.

2. **Access the Download Page:** Open your web browser and navigate to the
   following URL:

   ```txt
   https://cloud.3mdeb.com/index.php/s/{download_key}
   ```

   Replace `{download_key}` with the download key provided in your email.

3. **Enter Your Password:** Once you visit the above link, you'll be prompted
   to enter a password. Use the password from your subscription email.

4. **Download the Binaries:** After entering the password, you can access the
   cloud folder containing the binaries. You can now download them as needed.

**Example:**

- Suppose your download key is `abc123` and your password is
  `securepassword123`.
- You can visit `https://cloud.3mdeb.com/index.php/s/abc123`.
- When prompted, you would enter `securepassword123` as the password.
- After authentication, you can download your subscribed binaries.

**Notes:**

- Ensure you enter the download key and password exactly as they appear in your
  email, as they are case-sensitive.
- If you have not received your email or cannot find it, check your spam folder
  or contact Dasharo support for assistance.

Following these steps, you can access and download your Dasharo Entry
Subscription binaries without issues. If you encounter any problems, don't
hesitate to contact the Dasharo support team for further assistance.
