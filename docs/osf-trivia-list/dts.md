# Dasharo Tools Suite

## What is Dasharo Tools Suite?

Dasharo Tools Suite (DTS) is like a swiss army knife for Dasharo firmware: you
can execute initial deployment, firmware update and even dump machine logs for
debugging and development support.

Also refer to [DTS Overview](../dasharo-tools-suite/overview.md).

## How to get Dasharo Entry Subscription releases using Dasharo Tools Suite?

Dasharo Entry Subscription releases can be used to perform firmware updates
with DTS by providing Dasharo Supporters credentials obtained after buying a
[subscription](../ways-you-can-help-us.md#become-a-dasharo-supporter).

Commercial use of DTS should be discussed directly with
[3mdeb](mailto:leads@3mdeb.com) or [Dasharo Team](mailto:contact@dasharo.com).
