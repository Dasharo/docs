# Dasharo Tools Suite

## What is Dasharo Tools Suite?

Dasharo Tools Suite (DTS) is like a swiss army knife for Dasharo firmware: you
can execute initial deployment, firmware update and even dump machine logs for
debugging and development support.

Also refer to [DTS Overview](../dasharo-tools-suite/overview.md).

## How to get Dasharo Entry Subscription Releases using Dasharo Tools Suite?

Dasharo Entry Subscription Releases can be used to perform firmware updates
with DTS by providing Dasharo Entry Subscription credentials obtained after
buying a [Dasharo Entry Subscription](../ways-you-can-help-us.md#become-a-dasharo-entry-subscription-subscriber).

Commercial use of DTS should be discussed directly with
[3mdeb](mailto:leads@3mdeb.com) or [Dasharo Team](mailto:contact@dasharo.com).

### How can I use my Dasharo Entry Subscription credentials

<!-- Need to be replaced in case the menu changed. -->

After purchasing the Dasharo Entry Subscription, you should receive an email
with keys to use with [Dasharo Tools Suite](../dasharo-tools-suite/overview.md).
This section describes how to do it.

* Firstly, run DTS from a USB flash drive, documentation on this is included
  [here](../dasharo-tools-suite/documentation.md#bootable-usb-stick).

* After booting, you will see a text menu, choose option number 4,
  `Load your DES keys`, by pressing `4` and `Enter`.

* Next, rewrite the credentials received in the following order:
    - `logs key`,
    - `firmware download key`,
    - `password`.

* Credentials will be verified by DTS attempting to connect to our server. If
  successful, the message `Verification of the Dasharo DES was successful. They
  are valid and will be used.` will be displayed.

Below is a short video that present loading DES keys.
