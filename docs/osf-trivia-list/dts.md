# Dasharo Tools Suite

## What is Dasharo Tools Suite Supporters Entrance

Dasharo Tools Suite Supporters Entrance (DTS SE) is an extended version of
[DTS](../dasharo-tools-suite/overview.md) provided to Dasharo Supporters via
the [Supporters Entrance subscription](../ways-you-can-help-us.md#become-a-dasharo-supporter).
DTS is like a swiss army knife for Dasharo firmware: you can execute initial
deployment, firmware update and even dump machine logs for debugging and
development support. But with SE you could get updates for your own, customized
build configurations.

## How to get Dasharo Tools Suite Supporters Entrance?

DTS SE is available only to Dasharo Supporters for personal use. Commercial
use of DTS SE should be discussed directly with [3mdeb](mailto:leads@3mdeb.com)
or [Dasharo Team](mailto:contact@dasharo.com).
