Open Source Firmware Trivia Questions List (OSFTQL)
---------------------------------------------------

Goal of following questions list is to provide answers to terribly trivial
topics or questions that were asked and answered gazillion times. We believe to
move forward with so limited resources we have to stop wasting community
precious time on something we agree on, but move forward with discussion.

Other role of this list is to create taxonomy of OSF trivia questions for
community and Dasharo customers, to avoid repeating explanation of topics which
most of community already agree on.

## `[OSFTQL0001]` Where is firmware?

TODO: draw diagram based on famous training materials, that show where we have
firmware and where firmware will be in future

## `[OSFTQL0002]` Will OSF project support device X?

TODO: Explain how wrong is this question and why often there is no answer to it
on mailing list.
