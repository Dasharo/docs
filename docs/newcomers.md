# Newcomers

If you are new to Dasharo, this section is to help you get started using Dasharo
firmware and possibly contributing to making it better.

## coreboot

If you have no prior experience with coreboot, it's highly recommended to visit
OpenSecurityTraining2 and finish these courses:

* [Arch4031](https://p.ost2.fyi/courses/course-v1:OpenSecurityTraining2+Arch4031_x86-64_RV_coreboot+2021_v1/about),
* [Arch4021](https://p.ost2.fyi/courses/course-v1:OpenSecurityTraining2+4021_Intro_UEFI+2022_v1/about)

OpenSecurityTraining2 provides other great courses related to firmware, which
are all freely available [here](https://p.ost2.fyi/courses).

## Docker

coreboot needs a specific toolchain to be built, hence why it is usually built
inside of a Docker. In case of Dasharo, all images are built using Docker, so
you will make sure it works properly on your system.

Follow these two links:

* [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
* [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

Once you have Docker set up on your machine, you can pull docker images from
[coreboot/coreboot-sdk](https://hub.docker.com/r/coreboot/coreboot-sdk/tags)
(keep in mind that some platforms require older docker images).

To pull a Docker image, use:

```shell
docker pull coreboot/coreboot-sdk:<tag>
```

The typical procedure to build a coreboot image is as follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Dasharo/coreboot.git
```

```shell
cd coreboot
```

```shell
git checkout <platform>/release
```

```shell
docker run -u $UID --rm -it \
-v $PWD:/home/coreboot/coreboot
-w /home/coreboot/coreboot coreboot/coreboot-sdk:<tag>\
bash
```

```shell
cp configs/config.<platform> .config
```

```shell
make olddefconfig
```

```shell
make
```

## Dasharo Contribution

All code review and all issues related to Dasharo are resolved on
[GitHub](https://github.com/). An account there is necessary to contribute and
report issues. All Dasharo repositories can be found
[here](https://github.com/Dasharo).

When you have an account on GitHub go ahead and
[configure an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
It's also highly recommended to configure a GPG key before contributing
anything. Instructions to do that can be found
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account).
With that your account should be ready to contribute to Dasharo.

Since Dasharo is based on coreboot and edk2, it's best to contribute [directly
in the upstream](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/upstream-first/)
if possible. Refer to these documents:

* [contributing to coreboot](https://doc.coreboot.org/contributing/index.html)
* [contributing to edk2](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/EDK-II-Development-Process)

If for some reason you can't contribute your change in upstream repositories,
then consider contributing directly to Dasharo. Before doing anything it's
best to get familiar with [source code structure](https://docs.dasharo.com/dev-proc/source-code-structure/).
To create a patch:

1. [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks)
   which you want to edit,
1. in the forked repository: `git checkout <platform>/develop` (make sure to
   start from the correct branch),
1. create a new branch: `git checkout -b <platform>/<feature>`,
1. commit your changes:
    - make sure to sign your commits by using
      `git commit -sm "<commit_message>"`,
    - `<commit_message>` should be: `path/to/file: Change description`,
    - one commit should be one logical change,
1. [create a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

Do not forget to check whether patch has been reviewed and changes to your
contribution (PR) are needed. If so, remember about answering to each addressed
thread with information about change in the commit

* template: `Fixed: <link to commit>`
* example: Fixed [0a2a4ee](https://github.com/Dasharo/docs/pull/450/commits/0a2a4eecf9dc5bce1b3cc2edfa25046245e41ee2)

## Dasharo Matrix Space

[Matrix](https://matrix.org/) is a communicator used at Dasharo. If you want
quick answers it's best to join our matrix space and talk to us there.

[**Dasharo Matrix Space**](https://matrix.to/#/#dasharo:matrix.org)

If you've never used Matrix before, you will first need to get a client.
Available clients are listed [here](https://matrix.org/clients/).

## Dasharo lab user guide

[**Test environment overview**](https://github.com/Dasharo/open-source-firmware-validation?tab=readme-ov-file#test-environment-overview)

To get information about available platforms it's or it's RTE's IP address, use
the platform reservation tool: [SnipeIT](https://192.168.4.202/)

[OSFV_CLI](https://github.com/Dasharo/osfv-scripts/tree/main/osfv_cli) is a script,
which allows to interact with devices setup in Dasharo OSFV lab.

If the DUT has connected RTE you can refer to: [RTE
commands](https://github.com/Dasharo/osfv-scripts/blob/main/osfv_cli/README.md#rte-command),
also you may connect to the RTE by using web browser by typing:
`http://<rte_ip_address>:8000`. For more please refer to: [RTE Quick Start
Guide](https://docs.dasharo.com/transparent-validation/rte/v1.1.0/quick-start-guide/).

Default RTE login: `root`, password: `meta-rte`

If the DUT uses PiKVM you may use: `https://<PiKVM_ip_address>`, for more info
refer to:
[PiKVM](https://docs.dasharo.com/transparent-validation/pikvm/assembly-and-validation/).

Default PiKVM login: `admin`, password: `admin`

Firmware source: [Dasharo
Universe](https://docs.dasharo.com/variants/protectli_vp2410/releases/) or
[Cloud](https://cloud.3mdeb.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/projects/dasharo/releases&fileid=297139)
(only for logged in users), alternatively newest builds can be found at [Github](https://github.com/Dasharo/coreboot/).

Running tests: [Open Source Firmware Remote Test Environment](https://github.com/Dasharo/open-source-firmware-validation?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started)
It is strongly suggested to run your first test on [QEMU](https://github.com/Dasharo/open-source-firmware-validation?tab=readme-ov-file#qemu-workflow).
To prepare Ubuntu OS image for QEMU refer to: [Ubuntu OS](https://github.com/Dasharo/preseeds?tab=readme-ov-file#ubuntu),
after downloading and creating image copy ```ubuntu.iso```
to ```.../open-source-firmware-validation/qemu-data/```
also create a drive onto which the os is going to be installed by running

```qemu-img create -f qcow2 qemu-data/hdd.qcow2 20G```

run QEMU with:

```./scripts/ci/qemu-run.sh graphic os_install```

To start QEMU so that it boots to os run:

```./scripts/ci/qemu-run.sh graphic os```

## Troubleshooting

**Connecting to RTE serial output: `Connection refused`**

Most probably a telnet connection hasn't been closed correctly. To terminate
this connection restart RTE by logging to it by ssh and reboot it:

`ssh root@rte_ip_address`

password: meta-rte

`systemctl restart ser2net` and then `logout`

**DUT won't power on**

1. Use the [OSFV CLI](https://github.com/Dasharo/osfv-scripts/tree/main/osfv_cli).
Check if Sonoff state is set to ON `osfv_cli sonoff --sonoff_ip
<sonoff_ip_address> on` and power on the DUT `osfv_cli rte --rte_ip
<rte_ip_address> pwr on`

2. Check if a proper BIOS/firmware is flashed. If not a proper firmware can be
   flashed with use of [OSFV
   CLI](https://github.com/Dasharo/osfv-scripts/tree/main/osfv_cli) by running
   `osfv_cli rte --rte_ip <rte_ip_address> flash write --rom <path_to_fw_file>`
   command.

**Ubuntu won't download and create image**

1. Download image from: [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.task.gda.pl/ubuntu-releases/22.04.4/ubuntu-22.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso),
and use the script:

```./ubuntu/create_image.sh -i ~/Downloads/ubuntu-22.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso```
