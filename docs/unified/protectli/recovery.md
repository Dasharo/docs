# Recovery

=== "v1x1x"

    ## Intro

    The following documentation describes the process of recovering hardware from
    the brick state with [RTE](../../transparent-validation/rte/introduction.md) and
    Dasharo open-source firmware.

    ## Prerequisites

    * [Prepared RTE](../../transparent-validation/rte/v1.1.0/quick-start-guide.md)
    * 6x female-female wire cables

    ## Connections

    To prepare the stand for flashing follow the steps described below:

    1. Open the platform cover.
    2. Connect the 6-pin flash header to the
    [SPI header](../../transparent-validation/rte/v1.1.0/specification.md)
    on RTE.

        | SPI header | 6 pin header |
        |:----------:|:------------:|
        | Vcc        | pin 1 (Vcc)  |
        | GND        | pin 2 (GND)  |
        | CS         | pin 4 (CS)   |
        | SCLK       | pin 6 (CLK)  |
        | MISO       | pin 5 (MISO) |
        | MOSI       | pin 3 (MOSI) |

        ```txt
                    ______
                >  |      |
        Vcc 3.3V  ----1  2----  GND
                    |      |
            MOSI  ----3  4----  CS
                    |      |
            MISO  ----5  6----  CLK
                    |______|
        ```

    ## Firmware flashing

    To flash firmware follow the steps described below:

    1. Login to RTE via `ssh` or `minicom`.
    2. Turn on the platform by connecting the power supply.
    3. Wait at least 5 seconds.
    4. Turn off the platform by using the power button.
    5. Wait at least 3 seconds.
    6. Set the proper state of the SPI by using the following commands on RTE:

        ```bash
        # set SPI Vcc to 3.3V
        echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio405/value
        # SPI Vcc on
        echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio406/value
        # SPI lines ON
        echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio404/value
        ```

    7. Wait at least 2 seconds.
    8. Disconnect the power supply from the platform.
    9. Wait at least 2 seconds.
    10. Flash the platform by using the following command:

        ```bash
        flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=16000 -w [path_to_binary]
        ```

        > Flashing with flashrom takes about 1 minute.

    11. Change back the state of the SPI by using the following commands:

        ```bash
        echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio404/value
        echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio406/value
        ```

    12. Turn on the platform by connecting the power supply.

    The first boot of the platform after proceeding with the above procedure can
    take much longer than standard.
