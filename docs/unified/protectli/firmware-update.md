# Firmware update

The following documentation describes the process of Dasharo open-source
firmware update. If your device is currently flashed with the proprietary
firmware please refer to the [Initial deployment](initial-deployment.md)
documentation.

The update process may be different, depending on the currently installed
Dasharo firmware version.

For simplicity of the update process, we recommend using
[Dasharo Tools Suite](../../dasharo-tools-suite/overview.md).

=== "v1x1x"

   Before starting the update procedure be sure to disable Secure Boot:

   1. Power on the device.
   2. While the device is booting, hold the `DELETE` key to enter the UEFI Setup
      Menu.
   3. Enter the `Device Manager` menu.
   4. Enter the [Secure Boot Configuration](../../dasharo-menu-docs/device-manager.md#secure-boot-configuration)
      submenu.
   5. Verify that the `Current Secure Boot State` field says Disabled - if not,
      unselect the `Attempt Secure Boot` option below then press `F10` to save
      the changes.
   6. Reboot the device to properly apply the changes.

   The settings of all the above options can be restored after a firmware
   update.

   ## Updating Dasharo

   ```bash
   flashrom -p internal -w protectli_<variant>_v<version>.rom --fmap -i COREBOOT
   ```

=== "vp46xx"

   Before starting the update procedure be sure to disable Dasharo BIOS Boot
   medium lock and Secure Boot:

   1. Power on the device.
   2. While the device is booting, hold the `DELETE` key to enter the UEFI Setup
      Menu.
   3. Enter the `Dasharo System Features` menu using the arrow keys and Enter.
   4. Enter the [Dasharo Security Options](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-menu-docs/dasharo-system-features/#dasharo-security-options)
      submenu.
   5. Verify the state of the `Lock the BIOS boot medium` option - if the option
      is chosen, press `Space` and then `F10` to save the changes.
   6. Go back to the main menu using the `ESC` key.
   7. Enter the `Device Manager` menu.
   8. Enter the [Secure Boot Configuration](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-menu-docs/device-manager/#secure-boot-configuration)
      submenu.
   9. Verify that the `Current Secure Boot State` field says Disabled - if not,
      unselect the `Attempt Secure Boot` option below then press `F10` to save
      the changes.
   10. Reboot the device to properly apply the changes.

   The settings of all the above options can be restored after a firmware
   update.

   ## Updating to Dasharo v1.2.0

   Due to the major changes, such as ME update, and firmware layout adjustments
   (to store the boot logo), flashing of the whole firmware is required:

   ```shell
   flashrom -p internal -w protectli_vp46xx_v1.2.0.rom
   ```

   ## Updating to Dasharo v1.0.18 or v1.0.19 or v1.1.0

   From v1.0.18 Dasharo firmware is rebased on the more up-to-date revision of
   coreboot.

   If the current version of the firmware on the device is older than v1.0.18 or
   you are migrating from proprietary firmware the whole flash chip should be
   flashed as described in [Initial Deployment](initial-deployment.md).

   If the current version of the firmware on the device is v1.0.18 and it should
   be updated to v1.0.19 or v1.1.0, only the `WP_RO` and `RW_SECTION_A`
   should be flashed. To do this the following command should be used:

   ```bash
   flashrom -p internal -w protectli_vault_cml_v1.0.19.rom --fmap -i WP_RO -i RW_SECTION_A
   ```

   ## Updating on Dasharo v1.0.16 or v1.0.17

   Only the `RW_SECTION_A` partition of the flash needs to be updated. Flash it
   using the following command:

   ```bash
   flashrom -p internal -w protectli_vault_cml_v1.0.16.rom --fmap -i RW_SECTION_A
   ```

   This command also preserves Dasharo UEFI settings and the boot order.

   ## Updating on older Dasharo versions

   In this case, the whole `bios` region must be updated.

   ```bash
   flashrom -p internal -w protectli_vault_cml_v1.0.13.rom --ifd -i bios
   ```

=== "vp66xx"

   Before starting the update procedure be sure to disable Secure Boot:

   1. Power on the device.
   2. While the device is booting, hold the `DELETE` key to enter the UEFI Setup
      Menu.
   3. Enter the `Device Manager` menu.
   4. Enter the [Secure Boot Configuration](../../dasharo-menu-docs/device-manager.md#secure-boot-configuration)
      submenu.
   5. Verify that the `Current Secure Boot State` field says Disabled - if not,
      unselect the `Attempt Secure Boot` option below then press `F10` to save
      the changes.
   6. Reboot the device to properly apply the changes.

   The settings of all the above options can be restored after a firmware
   update.

   ## Updating Dasharo

   ```bash
   flashrom -p internal -w protectli_vp66xx_v<version>.rom --fmap -i RW_SECTION_A
```

=== "vp2410"

   Before starting the update procedure be sure to disable Dasharo BIOS Boot
   medium lock, SMM BIOS Write Protection and Secure boot:

   1. Power on the device.
   2. While the device is booting, hold the `DELETE` key to enter the UEFI Setup
      Menu.
   3. Enter the `Dasharo System Features` menu using the arrow keys and Enter.
   4. Enter the [Dasharo Security Options](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-menu-docs/dasharo-system-features/#dasharo-security-options)
      submenu.
   5. Verify the state of the `Lock the BIOS boot medium` and
      `Enable SMM BIOS write protection` options - if any of those are set,
      press `Space` to unselect them and then `F10` to save the changes.
   6. Go back to the main menu using the `ESC` key.
   7. Enter the `Device Manager` menu.
   8. Enter the [Secure Boot Configuration](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-menu-docs/device-manager/#secure-boot-configuration)
      submenu.
   9. Verify that the `Current Secure Boot State` field says Disabled - if not,
      unselect the `Attempt Secure Boot` option below then press `F10` to save
      the changes.
   10. Reboot the device to properly apply the changes.

   The settings of all the above options can be restored after a firmware
   update.

   ## Updating minor versions v1.x.y (e.g. from v1.0.x to v1.1.0)

   Full binary should be flashed:

   ```bash
   flashrom -p internal -w [path]
   ```

   ## Updating patch version v1.0.x/v1.1.x

   Only the `COREBOOT` and `IFWI` partition of the flash needs to be updated.
   Flash it using the following command:

   ```bash
   flashrom -p internal -w [path] --fmap -i COREBOOT -i IFWI
   ```

   This command also preserves Dasharo UEFI settings and the boot order.

   The settings of all the above options can be restored after a firmware
   update.

   ## Updating minor versions v1.x.y

   Both `WP_RO` and `RW_SECTION_A` partitions of the flash needs to be updated.
   Flash it using the following command:

   ```bash
   flashrom -p internal -w [path] --fmap -i RW_SECTION_A -i WP_RO
   ```

   This command also preserves current Dasharo UEFI settings and the boot order.

   ## Updating patch version v1.0.x

   Only the `RW_SECTION_A` partition of the flash needs to be updated. Flash it
   using the following command:

   ```bash
   flashrom -p internal -w [path] --fmap -i RW_SECTION_A
   ```

   This command also preserves Dasharo UEFI settings and the boot order.
