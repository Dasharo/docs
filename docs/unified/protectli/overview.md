=== "VP2430"
    The VP2430 is a small form network appliance built for use as a firewall
    / router, virtualization platform, a daily-driven personal computer,
    and more. A major difference setting it apart from its predecessors is the
    CPU. While the 2410 and 2420 models both utilize a J-series Intel Celeron,
    the VP2430 comes equipped with a more recent Alder Lake N-series CPU. This
    means a significant improvement in performance, at a comparable power
    consumption level. It also features 4 x 2.5G i226 ethernet ports.
