# NovaCustom Fn lock hotkey

By default, the `Function Keys` (++f1++ - ++f12++) must be used with a
combination of ++fn++ key to change display brightness, keyboard illumination,
etc. The `Fn lock` capability provides a way of using these actions without the
necessity of using the ++fn++ key.

## Usage

### Enabling

Press the ++fn+caps-lock++ keys combination.

### Disabling

Press the ++fn+caps-lock++ keys combination again.
