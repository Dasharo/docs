# NovaCustom Fn lock hotkey

The NovaCustom laptop features the Fn lock hotkey function. This function might
be used to change the behavior (action blockade) of the function keys
(`F1 - F12`).

## Usage

To turn on the lock of hotkeys function use `Fn + CapsLock` combination. If the
lock hotkeys functionality should be turned off, use the same combination.
