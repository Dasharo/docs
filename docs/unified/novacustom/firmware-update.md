# Firmware update

The following documentation describes the process of Dasharo open-source
firmware update. The update process may be different, depending on which
firmware version is currently installed on your device.

Your firmware version can be checked by entering the
[Dasharo Setup Menu](../../dasharo-menu-docs/overview.md#dasharo-menu-guides.md) using the
++f2++ key while booting.

=== "Dasharo (UEFI)"

    ## Prerequisites

    Depending on the firmware version, there may be manual steps required to ensure
    that the firmware can be updated. `11th Gen` devices starting from version v1.5.0
    and `12th Gen` devices starting from version v1.7.0 have support for [Firmware
    Update Mode](#firmware-update-mode). For older versions, please continue with
    the [Updating older versions](#updating-older-versions) section.

    > Advanced users can also [build](./building-manual.md) and/or flash the
    > binaries themselves by following the steps under the [Manual
    > update](#manual-update) section.

    ### Firmware Update Mode

    If the currently installed Dasharo version supports Firmware Update Mode, follow
    the steps outlined in the [generic Firmware Update documentation](../../guides/firmware-update.md#firmware-update-mode).

    Check out our [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muWjhrQ7bQk)
    for a demonstration of Firmware Update Mode.

    ### Updating older versions

    1. First, ensure that [UEFI Secure Boot](../../dasharo-tools-suite/documentation.md#disabling-secure-boot)
       has been disabled.

    1. Boot to the [Dasharo Tools Suite](../../dasharo-tools-suite/documentation.md#bootable-over-a-network).
       We recommend the network boot option.

    1. In the main menu of Dasharo Tools Suite, select option `5` to proceed with
       the installation of the firmware update.

    1. In case you want to know more about the firmware update option in Dasharo
       Tools Suite, please check out the
       [features section](../../dasharo-tools-suite/documentation.md#firmware-update)
       of the dedicated Dasharo Tools Suite documentation page.

    ### Manual update

    This update method is for advanced users only and is not recommended for
    regular end users.

    Ensure that the firmware protections are disabled (1) in
    [Dasharo Security Options](../../dasharo-menu-docs/dasharo-system-features.md).
    Both `BIOS boot medium lock` and `Enable SMM BIOS write protection` should
    be unchecked. [UEFI Secure Boot](../../dasharo-menu-docs/device-manager.md#secure-boot-configuration)
    must be disabled as well (uncheck `Attempt Secure Boot` if
    `Current Secure Boot State` does not say `Disabled`). To apply changes, you
    will need to reboot.
    { .annotate }

    1. These options were introduced in v1.5.0 for TGL models and v1.7.0 for ADL
       models. You can skip these steps if you are using an older firmware version.

    Follow the manual update procedure described in the [DTS firmware update
    documentation](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-tools-suite/documentation.md#local-firmware-update).

    > Please make sure you that you update the BIOS firmware and the EC firmware
    > respectively, as the laptop will power off after the EC firmware flash.
    >
    > Please also note that
    > [network boot must be enabled](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-menu-docs/dasharo-system-features.md#networking-options)
    > if you want to boot to the Dasharo Tools Suite over a network connection.

=== "Dasharo (coreboot + Heads)"

    ## Firmware update

    [Build](building-manual.md#dasharo-coreboot--head) or
    download Dasharo Heads firmware, and proceed with
    the official [Heads update documentation](https://osresearch.net/Updating).
