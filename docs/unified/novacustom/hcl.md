# Hardware Compatibility Lists

The following compatibility list contains devices and accessories that have been
tested to work with Dasharo firmware.

Feel free to perform different tests and report your results via
[email](mailto:contact@dasharo.com) or submit a Pull Request to
[Dasharo documentation repository](https://github.com/Dasharo/docs) or by using
[Dasharo issues repository](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues).

Devices listed with `Official support` are tested for each firmware release and
are guaranteed to be compatible. Reports noted as `Internal testing` come from
internal employee testing carried out by us, but aren't guaranteed to work.
Reports from the community should link to the appropriate GitHub PR and / or
issue from which the report is sourced.
