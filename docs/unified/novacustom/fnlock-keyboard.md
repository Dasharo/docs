# NovaCustom FnLock

The NovaCustom laptop features FnLock function. It's used to change behaviour of
function keys `F1` - `F12`. When active, function keys behave as `Fn` key is
pressed down.

## Usage

Use `Fn + CapsLock` to toggle FnLock function.

When FnLock is active, use function keys `F1` - `F12` as if `Fn` key is pressed
down.
