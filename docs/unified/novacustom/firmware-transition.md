# Firmware transition

## Introduction

This document describes the process of transitioning from Dasharo UEFI to Heads
and the other way around.

## Switching from Dasharo UEFI to Heads

To change firmware branches from UEFI to Heads, because of how different the two
firmware types are, it's required to disable some security measures before
flashing. Follow the steps below to install Heads from an existing Dasharo UEFI
firmware installation:

- Hold down the ++f2++ key and press the ++power++ button to enter the UEFI
  Setup Menu
- Enter the `Device Manager` submenu and disable `Secure Boot`
- Enter the `Dasharo System Features` submenu
- In the `Dasharo Security Options` submenu, disable:
    + SMM BIOS Write Protection
    + BIOS boot medium lock
- In the `Intel Management Engine Options` submenu disable the Management Engine

!!! tip

    For a more detailed guide on the UEFI Setup Menu options, check out the
    [Dasharo menu documentation](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-menu-docs/).

- [Boot into Dasharo Tools Suite](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-tools-suite/documentation/#running)
- Enter your DES subscription credentials
- Select `Update Dasharo firmware` to check for updates
- When asked to switch to Heads firmware, press `Y`
- Proceed with [DTS firmware update](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-tools-suite/documentation/#firmware-update)
  as usual

When the update is finished, your laptop will shut down automatically. Power it
back on to boot into your new Heads installation!

!!! warning "TOTP secrets warning"

    On the first boot, you will be shown a warning about TOTP secrets. This is
    normal and expected on the first boot. Run `OEM Factory Reset /
    Re-Ownership` to finish deploying Heads.

    Check out [Heads documentation](https://osresearch.net/Configuring-Keys/#oem-factory-resetre-ownership)
    for a detailed factory reset guide.

!!! note "Note for Qubes OS users"

    After installing Qubes while Heads is installed, you will need to select
    `Reset TPM` in the Heads menu to finish the installation.

    From the main menu, enter `Options` -> `TPM/TOTP/HOTP Options` and select
    `Reset the TPM`.

    Users upgrading to Heads while Qubes is already installed are not affected.

## Switching from Dasharo Heads back to UEFI

To revert back to UEFI, you will need to boot into DTS from a USB stick.

- Follow the [Dasharo Tools Suite documentation](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-tools-suite/documentation/#running)
  to boot DTS from a USB stick
- In the DTS main menu, select `Update Dasharo firmware` to check for available
  updates.
- When prompted to revert back to UEFI, press `Y`
- Proceed with [DTS firmware update](https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-tools-suite/documentation/#firmware-update)
  as usual

Once finished, your laptop will shut down automatically. Power it back on to
boot into your UEFI firmware.

> When reverting to UEFI, it's not possible to restore EFI boot manager entries
> that were added before installing Heads. Therefore, you may need to re-create
> your boot entries manually, or find your boot loader using `Boot From File`
> option in the UEFI setup menu.

## Logo customization

Normally, the logo can be replaced using the
[Dasharo Configuration Utility](https://github.com/Dasharo/dcu?tab=readme-ov-file#dcu---dasharo-configuration-utility)
â€“ a tool designed to modify Dasharo binary images. However, logo customization is
not supported as of now. To replace the logo, one must rebuild the firmware. You
would need to replace the `branding/Dasharo/bootsplash.jpg` with your own, and
proceed with the
[Building manual](/unified/novacustom/building-manual/#dasharo-coreboot--heads).
