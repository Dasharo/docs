    ## Firmware

    Each firmware release contains of two parts:

    - [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS) firmware,
    - [EC (Embedded Controller)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_controller)
      firmware.

    They both interact with each other tightly, so keeping their compatible versions
    in sync is important. Information on compatibility should always be explained
    on the release pages:

    - [NV4x 12th Gen](/variants/novacustom_nv4x_adl/releases/)
    - [NV4x 11th Gen](/variants/novacustom_nv4x_tgl/releases/)
    - [NS5x/7x 12th Gen](/variants/novacustom_ns5x_adl/releases/)
    - [NS5x/7x 11th Gen](/variants/novacustom_ns5x_tgl/releases/)
