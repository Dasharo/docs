## Firmware

Each firmware release contains of two parts:

- [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS) firmware,
- [EC (Embedded Controller)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_controller)
  firmware.

They both interact with each other tightly, so keeping their compatible versions
in in sync is important. Information on compatibility should be always explained
in the release pages:

- [NV4x ADL](/variants/novacustom_nv4x_adl/releases/)
- [NV4x TGL](/variants/novacustom_nv4x_tgl/releases/)
- [NS5x ADL](/variants/novacustom_ns5x_adl/releases/)
- [NS5x TGL](/variants/novacustom_ns5x_tgl/releases/)
