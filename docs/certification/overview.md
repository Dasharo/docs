# Dasharo Certification Program

Our commitment to long-term maintenance and transparent validation lead us to
creation of Dasharo Certification Program (DCP). We would like to recognize
that without strict project management, hardware integration and validation
procedures maintaining significant number of hardware targets would be
impossible.

More to that to maintain open-source firmware for multiple hardware targets we
have expect certain quality from code

Dasharo Certification Program consist of three main parts:

* Dasharo Onboarding with Silicon Vendor
* Project Infrastructure Setup for Dasharo Certification Program
* Lab Setup for Dasharo Certification Program

Dasharo Certificate consists of test procedures, test results report, and test
logs confirming compliance with Program scope. All results of public Dasharo
Certification Program will be accessible publicly.

* [Dasharo Universe](https://docs.dasharo.com)
* [Dasharo Github](https://github.com/Dasharo)

Obviously not all our customers wish to publish Dasharo Certification results.
We respect will of our customers to not make Dasharo Certificaiton public.

## Goals

We hope that Dasharo Certification Program will lead to:

* establishing certain standard for quality of open-source firmware distributions
* better understand of real cost of open-source firmware maintenance
* increase number of certified hardware platforms by bringing already
  platforms which are already ported to open-source firmware, but there are no
  quality control during the release process

## Dasharo Onboarding with Silicon Vendor

Critical part of creating any open-source firmware port since without
documentation any development have to rely on gaining adversarial
interoperability, what may be resource-intensive or in some cases even
impossible. Over the years we realize how to correctly onboard project and
build mutual relation between customers, Silicon Vendor and us. As a result we
included Dasharo Onboarding with Silicon Vendor in Dasharo Certification
Program and make it mendatory part.

There are rare exceptions from onboarding, but it always have to be decided
individually with customer.

## Project Infrastructure Setup for Dasharo Certification Program

Project Infrastructure Setup is first step of Dasharo Certification Program, it
consist of structural approach to following activities:

* formal Software Provider's resource allocation including legal, logistics and
  financial fees,
* program kick-off,
* program execution plan monitoring, coordination and communication,
* Dasharo Certification release quality control.

## Lab Setup for Dasharo Certification Program

Every Dasharo Certification candidate have to be integrated in Dasharo
Certification Laboratory. Correct integration means:

* detailed analysis of Client's Infrastructure schematics and documentation,
* setup of remote and automated environment for development, debugging and testing,
* Client's Infrastructure preparation for manual testing procedures, if not all
  tests can be automated,
* provisioning and configuration of Dasharo Transparent Validation system that
  will execute test required for Dasharo Certification Program,

Details of this proces are described for selected platforms in [Assembly Guides]().

## Limitations

Dasharo is registered trademark of 3mdeb Sp. z o.o. Poland-based limited
liability company. Only OEMs and communities, which obtained Dasharo
Certification are allowed to use Dasharo logo for open-source firmware
promotion.

## About DCP documentation sections

### Lab Setup Guides

Lab Setup Guides were created for individuals, organizations and Dasharo
Validation Team members who would like to setup supported hardware platform as
in Dasharo Certification Lab or in homelab. Documentation describe how RTE can
be connected to Device Under Test to get rully automated developement,
debugging and testing environment.

### Pre-sale Device Assembly

Pre-sale Device Assembly guides were created for Dasharo Sales Team members and
partner organizations who would like to create Dasharo Cerified Configuration.
We also offer most of explained configurations in [3mdeb
shop](https://3mdeb.com/shop/).

## Naming conventions

Dasharo programs are called after microarchitectures supported as part of given
program e.g. Dasharo Intel Alder Lake P Certification Program for MSI PRO
Z790-A DDR5.
